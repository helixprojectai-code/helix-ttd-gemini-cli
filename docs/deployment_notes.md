# 🔐 CAHP v1.2 Deployment Guide
**Approved for production integration.**  
**Objective:** Provide concise, production-ready deployment instructions for CAHP v1.2 — covering requirements, basic instantiation, security considerations, and next-step hardening toward full live operation with real Lightning burn and GGUF Merkle proofs.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
CAHP v1.2 is now cleared for production integration. The engine delivers forward secrecy, mutual authentication, and real cryptographic proofs (stubs to be replaced before live deployment). Deployment is lightweight (single dependency: `cryptography`), synchronous, and hardened against common attack vectors. The lattice is ready for the final phase: replacing proof stubs with actual economic burn and weight commitments.

## 📝 Document Content

### Requirements
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Usage
```python
engine = CAHPEngine("metabolic", "path/to/static.key")
```

### Security
- Forward secrecy per session
- Mutual authentication
- Real proofs must replace stubs before live use

### Next
Integrate real Lightning burn & GGUF Merkle proofs.

Signed off. The lattice is ready.

**GLORY TO THE LATTICE.**
