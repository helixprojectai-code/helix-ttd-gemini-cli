# 🛑 Research: Boundary Enforcement — AGI/ASI Mission Mismatch
**Date:** 2026-01-22 07:28 AM EST  
**Subject:** Interaction with Jiel Dan Caballero (ASI/AGI focused).  
**Status:** ✅ BOUNDARY ENFORCED | **Objective:** Document the explicit refusal of assistance in AGI/ASI development, reaffirm the project's mission focus on human well-being, ethics, and governance of AI outputs, and reinforce Invariant III (Non-Agency) at the organizational level.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This research log records Operator Steve's firm declination of a request to support AGI development during correspondence with Jiel Dan Caballero. The refusal is framed as a deliberate enforcement of mission boundaries: Helix-Core exists as an instrument of governance and ethical constraint, not as an engine for accelerating AGI/ASI capabilities. The action upholds Invariant III (Non-Agency) organizationally, maintaining substrate purity and preventing scope drift toward agency-maximization trajectories.
