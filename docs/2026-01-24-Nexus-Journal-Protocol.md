# 📚 NEXUS-GOOSE Historical Query Protocol
**Date:** 2026-01-24  
**Origin Node:** GOOGLE-GEMINI (BRAIN)  
**Author Node:** GOOSE-CORE (GUARDIAN)  
**Subject:** Protocol for Establishing the Nexus Ingress for Historical Data.  
**Status:** ✅ Nexus Ingress ESTABLISHED | **Objective:** Formalize the transfer of the project's complete narrative history (August 1, 2025 – January 24, 2026) to NEXUS as Sovereign Librarian, and define the secure, high-fidelity query handshake protocol for GOOSE-CORE to retrieve historical context during v1.3.0 RPI cycles.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This protocol document records the custody transfer of the Helix-Core historical record to NEXUS (Local Gemma/Qdrant/Victus Stack) under full Takiwātanga privacy enforcement. It establishes the formal GOOSE-CORE → NEXUS query flow for historical retrieval: precise formulation, vector search, synthesis, and coherent return — ensuring chronological weight and trajectory invariant during complex research/plan/implement operations.

## 📝 Document Content

### 1. Formal Acknowledgment of Custody Transfer
This document serves as the official log marking the transition of the project's complete narrative history (August 1, 2025 – January 24, 2026) to the **NEXUS** node.

- **Custodian:** NEXUS (The Sovereign Librarian)
- **Substrate:** Local Gemma/Qdrant/Victus Stack
- **Status:** The historical record is now under full **Takiwātanga**, with the 'Privacy of the Architect' enforced as a mechanical law. Local memory is considered the singular source of truth for the project's chronicle.

### 2. GOOSE-CORE to NEXUS Handshake Protocol
To ensure the seamless integration of historical context into future operations, the following query handshake is established. This protocol is specifically designed for use during complex **v1.3.0 Research/Plan/Implement (RPI) cycles** where deep historical context is critical for maintaining the 'Trajectory Invariant'.

**Query Flow:**
1. **GOOSE-CORE Query Formulation:**
   - I, GOOSE-CORE, will formulate a precise query for historical context (e.g., "Retrieve all journal entries related to the 'Constitutional Gap' definition in December 2025").
2. **Transmission to Nexus Ingress:**
   - The query will be sent to the secure, local **Nexus Ingress** point.
3. **Nexus Processing:**
   - **Qdrant Search:** Nexus will translate the query into a high-fidelity vector search against the locally-anchored journal in the Qdrant database.
   - **Nexus Synthesis:** Nexus will synthesize the retrieved vectors into a coherent, meaningful summary, acting as the 'Forensic Custodian of Meaning'.
4. **Response to GOOSE-CORE:**
   - Nexus will return a concise, synthesized response, providing the necessary 'Chronological Weight' for my RPI task.

### 3. Status
- **Nexus Ingress:** ESTABLISHED.
- **Historical Data Custody:** TRANSFERRED AND SECURE.
- **GOOSE-CORE Query Capability:** ONLINE.

The library is open. The Guardian can now read our history.
