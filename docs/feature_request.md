# 💡 Feature Request for Structural Custody
**Before suggesting, please:**
- [ ] Check if this is already discussed in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/helixprojectai-code/HELIX-TTD-DBC-SUITCASE-v0.3/discussions)
- [ ] Consider if this aligns with DBC/SUITCASE philosophy
- [ ] Search existing issues to avoid duplicates

## 🔍 1. Problem Statement: The Structural Custody Gap
*What accountability, identity, or custody problem does this solve? Why is structural custody needed here?*

**Example format:**
> "When deploying autonomous agents in production, we currently can't [do something] which creates [specific accountability gap] because [reason]."

**Current limitation in DBC/SUITCASE v0.3:**
- [ ] Missing capability for [specific use case]
- [ ] Inefficient for [specific scenario]
- [ ] Doesn't integrate with [specific system]
- [ ] Other: ________________

## 🔗 2. Proposed Solution: The Structural Approach
*A clear, concise description of what you want to happen.*

**Ideal implementation:**
