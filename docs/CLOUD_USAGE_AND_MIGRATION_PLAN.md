# ☁️ Helix-Core Cloud Usage and Migration Plan
**Status:** ✅ Active & Transitional | **Objective:** Outline the limited, ethical use of cloud resources during Helix-Core's early development phase, affirm compliance with provider policies, and detail the migration roadmap to local, self-hosted models for full sovereignty and non-dependence.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This plan positions Helix-Core as open-source governance infrastructure (not a hosted service), using temporary cloud credits (~CAD$400, 85% consumed) for prototyping without scraping or bulk harvesting. It commits to policy compliance, non-competition, and a shift to local models — ensuring cloud remains optional scaffolding, not core dependency, aligning with self-custody and verifiable sovereignty.

(Development Credits, Data Ethics, and Long-Term Architecture)

### 1. Context and Intent
Helix-Core is being developed as an open-source Constitutional AI framework focused on governance, verifiable sovereignty, and self-custody of data, not as a hosted retail AI assistant or corporate agent service. Its long-term architecture assumes self-hosted or user-controlled models, with cloud providers used only as temporary development scaffolding during early habitat bring-up.

During this initial phase, limited cloud resources have been used to accelerate prototyping and hardening of GOOSE-CORE and associated Civic Firmware, with a clear plan to exit cloud inference in favour of locally hosted models.

### 2. Current Cloud Usage
A single major cloud provider (Google Cloud) has been used under a one-time promotional credit (approximately CAD$400) to support:
- Initial GOOSE-CORE spin-up and experimentation.
- Backup search / inference during early development and debugging.

Roughly 85% of that credit has been consumed over the most recent development period, primarily for:
- Test runs of constitutional habitat behaviour.
- Validation of ledger and permission mechanisms under realistic load.

No large-scale scraping, continuous crawling, or bulk data harvesting is performed. External calls are limited to:
- Targeted search / inference operations needed for GOOSE-CORE’s development and testing.
- Normal, documented use of cloud APIs as intended by the provider.

In other words, cloud resources are being used as development infrastructure, not as a production-grade inference backend for end-users.

### 3. Data and Policy Posture
The following principles guide cloud usage:
- **No scraping:** The system does not run automated scraping pipelines; it relies on standard, supported API calls within documented limits, and does not attempt to circumvent rate limits or access restrictions.
- **Good-faith policy compliance:** Provider terms and acceptable-use policies are checked periodically. When changes are identified, Helix-Core’s usage patterns are reviewed, and adjustments are made as needed to avoid competitive or prohibited use.
- **Non-competition stance:** Helix AI Innovations does not intend to operate a retail AI assistant, chatbot product, or managed corporate agent that competes directly with cloud providers’ own AI offerings. Helix-Core is positioned as:
  - Open-source governance infrastructure (constitutional grammar, Civic Firmware, SSI-aligned vaults, ledger tooling).
  - Optional, narrowly scoped services such as Merkle-to-Bitcoin anchoring and audits, which sit at the verification and compliance layer, not at the end-user AI service layer.
- **Transparency of AI assistance:** When external AI systems contribute to design or documentation, this is acknowledged in governance/hardening documents, while retaining clear ownership of Helix-Core as an independent, open-source project.

### 4. Migration Plan to Local Models
Once the current development and hardening cycle is complete, the intended architecture is:
- **Primary inference on local Helix server models:**
  - Models hosted on hardware controlled by Helix or by deploying communities/organizations.
  - Cloud providers become optional, pluggable backends rather than a default dependency.
- **Cloud usage reduced to optional extensions:**
  - Burst capacity or specialized models, when explicitly configured by an operator.
  - Never a mandatory component for running the constitutional habitat.
- **Configuration defaults:**
  - Default deployments of HELIX-CORE will ship configured to use local or user-provided endpoints.
  - Any cloud integration will be clearly marked as optional and off by default, requiring deliberate operator choice.

### 5. Summary
In this early phase, Helix-Core uses limited cloud credits to accelerate development of a self-governing, self-hostable AI habitat. The project:
- Avoids scraping and abusive data practices.
- Makes reasonable, documented efforts to comply with provider policies.
- Does not aim to compete with retail AI agent products.
- Has a clear plan to migrate core inference to local models, leaving cloud services as optional, bounded integrations.

This approach aligns Helix-Core’s development with its core mission: human-first governance, verifiable sovereignty, and infrastructure that communities can ultimately run on their own terms.
