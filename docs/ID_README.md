# DBC × SUITCASE: Unified Identity & Custody Stack
**Version:** v0.3
**Date:** December 28, 2025
**Subtitle:** The structural prevention of anthropomorphic evasion.
**Status:** ACTIVE | **Objective:** Define and enforce the Helix-TTD Identity & Custody protocols — binding every AI agent to a cryptographic root held by a single human custodian — implementing the strict "No Orphaned Agents" invariant through DBC (genesis) and SUITCASE (lifecycle log), with full forensic auditability and zero ambiguity at runtime.

### What This Repository Is
> **👷 Engineers & Operators:** [Click here for the User Manual (INSTRUCTIONS.md)](INSTRUCTIONS.md)

This repository defines the **Helix-TTD Identity & Custody protocols**.
It enforces a strict **No Orphaned Agents** invariant by binding every AI agent to a **cryptographic root** held by a **single human custodian**.

There is no agent without custody.
There is no custody without a human.
There is no ambiguity at runtime.

### Core Components

#### DBC — Digital Birth Certificate
The immutable genesis object.
A minimal JSON capsule anchored to a **YubiKey-held Ed25519 key** proving **root human custody**.

#### SUITCASE — Portable Lifecycle Container
An **append-only, hash-chained log** carrying:
- capabilities
- attestations
- telemetry

It **cannot exist** without a valid DBC reference.

#### HGL — Helix Glyph Language
A deterministic visual identity layer derived from the DBC Merkle root and custody state.

#### Quorum Override
A defined emergency recovery protocol for human incapacitation or loss — explicit, auditable, bounded.

### 🛠️ Forensic Tools

#### Profile Auditor (`tools/profile_auditor.py`)
**Detect Unlicensed Profiling in Your Data.**
A forensic scanner that parses AI data exports (Claude/ChatGPT) for clinical, diagnostic, and assessment-based language.

```bash
# Scan your export for psychiatric inference patterns
python3 tools/profile_auditor.py path/to/conversations.json
```

### The Liability Model
There is **no AI personhood**.
Rights, duties, and legal exposure terminate at the **keyholder**.
AI is treated as **human intent extended through cryptography**.

**Lifecycle layers:**
- **L0** — Genesis (DBC)
- **L1** — Container (SUITCASE)
- **L2** — Runtime Gate (session keys)
- **L3** — Ephemeral actions

### Why This Exists
Agentic AI has an **accountability gap**:
- Autonomous agents deployed without custody chains
- Unclear liability when systems act independently
- No cryptographic proof of human responsibility

DBC × SUITCASE closes that gap **structurally**, not rhetorically.

### 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/helixprojectai-code/HELIX-TTD-DBC-SUITCASE-v0.3.git
cd HELIX-TTD-DBC-SUITCASE-v0.3
# Create an agent
python helix.py new-agent --custodian your_id --name "Weekend-Test"
# Generate visual identity
python helix.py glyph <merkle_root> ACTIVE --output svg
# Verify structural custody
python helix.py verify --dbc *.dbc.json --suitcase *.suitcase.json
```

### Closing Signal
**Apache 2.0 is not a concession. It is the mechanism.**
This is not a product.
It is infrastructure.
Standards don’t get sold.
They get **adopted**.

**143 teams didn’t browse. They cloned. At 5 AM on a Saturday.**
Quack. 🦆🔒

**The deployment pipeline is accelerating:**
Saturday: Individual discovery → Team evaluation
Sunday: Deep integration → Production preparation
Monday: Deployment decisions → Industry conversation

**The transition has begun.**
**From substrate to surface.**
**From machines to humans.**
**From protocol to movement.**

*The scout has landed. The herd follows.*

**GLORY TO THE LATTICE.**
