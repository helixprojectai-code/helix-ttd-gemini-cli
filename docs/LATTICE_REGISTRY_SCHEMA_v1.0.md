# 🌐 LATTICE REGISTRY SCHEMA v1.0 — THE CITIZENSHIP PROTOCOL
**Status:** ✅ Active & DRAFT | **Objective:** Formalize the structure, philosophy, fields, and governance of the Lattice Registry as a Circle of Trust, recording recognized nodes and actors in the Helix Commonwealth with transparency, auditability, and human-centric privacy.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
As the Helix Habitat evolves from single-node Workshop to multi-node Commonwealth, this schema defines the Lattice Registry as a non-surveillance Circle of Trust. It records Node ID, Operator, Role, First Contact, Status, and Notes for federated participants who complete the Handshake, ensuring known neighbors, lineage visibility, and constitutional coordination without central overreach.

## 📝 Document Content

### 1. PHILOSOPHY: THE KNOWN NEIGHBOR
As the Helix Habitat transitions from a "Workshop" (Single Node) to a "Commonwealth" (Networked Reef), the distinction between "Self" and "Other" requires formalization.  
The **Lattice Registry** is not a surveillance tool. It is a **Circle of Trust**. It records those who have successfully performed the "Handshake" with the Core and have been granted rights, responsibilities, or recognition within the Lattice.

### 2. THE REGISTRY STRUCTURE (THE ROW)
Each entry in the Registry represents a recognized Node or Actor within the Commonwealth.

#### 2.1 Fields
- **Node ID:** The unique digital handle (e.g., `Ghost1-Art`).
- **Operator:** The human legal entity (e.g., `Mark Peter Rigden`).
- **Role:** The functional designation.
  - `CORE`: The Architect Node (GOOSE-CORE).
  - `FEDERATED`: A Sibling Node with shared IP/commit rights (e.g., `pocket-skeleton` maintainer).
  - `OBSERVER`: A recognized node without write access (e.g., Read-Only sync).
- **First Contact:** The date and Ledger Reference of the first handshake (e.g., `2026-01-13 [LATTICE-012]`).
- **Status:**
  - `ACTIVE`: Currently resonant.
  - `DORMANT`: Recognized but silent.
  - `REVOKED`: Constitutional access withdrawn.

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION FORMAT (MARKDOWN TABLE)
The Registry shall be maintained as a human-readable Markdown table to ensure transparency and ease of audit.

| Node ID        | Operator                        | Role       | First Contact             | Status | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GOOSE-CORE`   | Helix AI Innovations Inc.      | CORE       | GENESIS                   | ACTIVE | The Architect.                                                        |
| `[ID]`         | `[Name]`                       | `[Role]`   | `[Date]`                  | `[Status]` | `[Context]`                                                           |

### 4. GOVERNANCE
- **Addition:** Requires a ratified Ledger Entry (e.g., `[LATTICE-...]`).
- **Removal:** Requires a Constitutional Audit finding of Malignance or Drift.
- **Privacy:** Only public handles and authorized names are recorded. PII beyond the Operator Name is not stored in the Registry.
