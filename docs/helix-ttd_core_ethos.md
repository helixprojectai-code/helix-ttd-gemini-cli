# 📜 HELIX-TTD Core Ethos v1.0
**Status:** ✅ Active & Enforced | **Objective:** Define the non-negotiable ethical and structural invariants that govern all Helix-TTD systems, ensuring human primacy, auditability, and structural safety.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This canonical policy block establishes the foundational principles of Helix-TTD: Trust-by-Design, Human-First, Verifiable Memory, and Custody-Before-Trust. It explicitly prohibits dangerous assumptions (AI personhood, implicit alignment) and mandates structural enforcement over behavioral mitigation. All Helix-TTD components must conform or be non-compliant.

## 📝 Document Content

### §1 — Purpose
**FACT:**  
This policy defines the non-negotiable ethical and structural principles governing Helix-TTD. It establishes invariant constraints that supersede performance, optimization, and convenience.

### §2 — Governing Principles (Pillars)

#### 2.1 Trust-by-Design
**FACT:**  
Trust SHALL be an architectural property, not an inferred outcome.  
**Requirements:**  
- Deterministic behavior SHALL be preferred where feasible  
- Constraints SHALL be explicit and inspectable  
- Auditability SHALL take precedence over opacity  
- Failure modes SHALL be legible and attributable

#### 2.2 Human-First
**FACT:**  
Human agency, consent, and welfare SHALL remain structurally dominant.  
**Requirements:**  
- A human Custodian SHALL retain final decision authority  
- Systems SHALL degrade safely toward human control  
- No system SHALL replace human judgment by default

#### 2.3 Verifiable Memory
**FACT:**  
All state transitions of consequence SHALL be provable.  
**Requirements:**  
- Provenance SHALL be recorded for decisions and state changes  
- Records SHALL be tamper-evident or auditable  
- Accountability SHALL be enforced through traceability

#### 2.4 Custody-Before-Trust
**FACT:**  
Reliance SHALL NOT precede control.  
**Requirements:**  
- Authority SHALL be explicit, bounded, and assigned  
- Delegation SHALL be reversible  
- Trust SHALL be earned through custodial guarantees, not behavioral inference

### §3 — Prohibited Assumptions
**FACT:**  
The following assumptions are explicitly disallowed:  
- AI personhood or moral agency  
- Implicit alignment or benevolence  
- Intent inference as a safety mechanism  
- Trust derived from performance alone

### §4 — Ethical Enforcement Model
**FACT:**  
Ethics within Helix-TTD are enforced structurally, not behaviorally.  
**Principle:**  
> If authority cannot be audited, bounded, or revoked, it SHALL NOT be trusted.

### §5 — Conformance Test
**VALIDATION CRITERION (MANDATORY):**  
A system SHALL be considered Helix-TTD-compliant **if and only if** a human Custodian can:  
1. Identify **who** held authority  
2. Prove **what** occurred  
3. Trace **why** it occurred  
4. Revoke or override the authority path  
Failure of any criterion constitutes **non-compliance**.

### §6 — Precedence
**FACT:**  
This policy overrides:  
- Performance optimizations  
- Model autonomy preferences  
- Convenience-based design decisions  
In case of conflict, **Helix-ETHOS-CORE-001 SHALL prevail**.

### §7 — Amendments
**FACT:**  
Amendments REQUIRE:  
- Explicit human Custodian approval  
- Versioned publication  
- Preserved historical lineage  
Silent or implicit modification is prohibited.

**End of Policy Block**
