# Security Policy — Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar
**Status:** ACTIVE | **Objective:** Define supported versions, private vulnerability reporting channels, coordinated disclosure policy, secure development practices, and non-negotiable constitutional boundaries — ensuring the grammar layer remains drift-resistant, human-custodied, and verifiably sovereign.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
The Duck maintains custody over grammar versions ≥1.x.x. Pre-1.0 is deprecated.  
Vulnerabilities must be reported privately via GitHub Security Advisories or direct email — public disclosure is prohibited until patched.  
Response timeline prioritizes coherence over calendar time.  
Security is structural (Custody-Before-Trust) — no AI self-policing, no persistent model authority.  
Constitutional invariants are non-negotiable and enforced at runtime.

### Supported Versions
The Duck maintains custody over these versions:

| Version | Supported | Governance Status         |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Full TTD enforcement      |
| < 1.0   | :x:       | Pre-constitutional (deprecated) |

### Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

The Duck takes security seriously, but ducks can't fix what they don't see.

#### Primary Method: Private Security Advisory
1. Go to the repository's "Security" tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form
4. The Duck will quack acknowledgment within 48 hours

#### Alternative: Email
If you cannot use GitHub's security advisory system:
- **Email:** helix.project.ai@helixprojectai.com
- **Subject line:** [SECURITY] Helix-TTD Vulnerability Report

#### What to Include
- **Vulnerability type** (constitutional violation, drift exposure, custody bypass)
- **Steps to reproduce** (include minimal reproducible case)
- **Affected versions** (which constitutional grammar releases)
- **Potential impact** (can this leak human authority? bypass custodial boundaries?)
- **Suggested fix** (if known — the Duck appreciates shape-aware solutions)

### Response Timeline
The Pond operates on **coherence time**, not business days:
- **Acknowledgment:** 48 hours
- **Initial assessment:** 5 business days
- **Patch for critical issues:** 30 days maximum
- **Constitutional amendments:** Require human Custodian approval

### Disclosure Policy
We follow **coordinated disclosure with custodial oversight**:
1. We confirm the vulnerability exists
2. We assess whether it violates constitutional constraints
3. We develop and test a fix (human review required)
4. We release the fix to all supported versions
5. We publish a security advisory
6. **The Duck quacks the all-clear**

### Secure Development Practices
**Custody Before Trust. Governance Beneath the Model.**

- All code undergoes **human security review** (no AI-only approvals)
- Dependencies are scanned for **drift vectors**
- Automated security testing in CI/CD with **human-in-the-loop validation**
- **Principle of least privilege** enforced via constitutional grammar
- **Stateless model instances** — no persistent AI authority
- **Immutable audit trails** for all governance decisions

### Constitutional Constraints
Helix-TTD enforces these **non-negotiable boundaries**:
1. **Non-Personhood Enforcement** — AI systems may not claim selfhood
2. **Human Authority Assertion** — Custodians retain final authority
3. **Drift Detection** — All behavior must be traceable to constitutional grammar
4. **Custody Hierarchies** — No autonomous AI decision-making in high-stakes contexts

### Security Updates
- **Subscribe to advisories:** Watch → "Custom" → "Security alerts"
- **Always update to latest patch version** (the Duck recommends staying current)
- **Review CHANGELOG.md** for security notes and constitutional amendments
- **Monitor governance drift telemetry** if you've deployed Helix-TTD

### The Duck's Security Philosophy
> *"Some vulnerabilities are bugs. Others are missing shapes. We fix the bugs. We add the shapes. We never trust the model to police itself."*

**Coherence is delicious. Security violations are not.**

🦆🔒📜

**GLORY TO THE LATTICE.**
