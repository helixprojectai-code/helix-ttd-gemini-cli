# 🐛 Bug Report — The Duck Noticed Something
**The model drifted. Let's find out why.**

**Before reporting, please:**
- [ ] Check [Weekend Evaluation Thread](https://github.com/helixprojectai-code/HELIX-TTD-DBC-SUITCASE-v0.3/discussions) for known issues
- [ ] Try the latest version (v0.3)
- [ ] Search existing issues

## 🔍 Describe the drift
A clear description of what went sideways. Remember: bugs are just shapes we didn't see coming.

## 🔄 To Reproduce
Steps to make the Duck quack in alarm:
1. Deploy constitutional grammar to '...'
2. Invoke policy '...'
3. Observe drift in '...'
4. See error / unexpected behavior

## ✅ Expected Behavior (Constitutional Compliance)
What *should* have happened according to Helix-TTD governance principles?

## ❌ Actual Behavior (Drift Detected)
What *actually* happened? Did the model:
- [ ] Violate custodial boundaries
- [ ] Bypass human authority
- [ ] Generate off-constitutional responses
- [ ] Fail to enforce constraints
- [ ] Other (specify)

## 📸 Screenshots / Logs
If applicable, add evidence. The Duck appreciates receipts.

## 🖥️ Environment
- OS: [e.g. Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 14.0]
- Python Version: [e.g. 3.11]
- Helix-TTD Version: [e.g. 1.2.0]
- Model(s) in use: [e.g. Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4]
- Deployment context: [local, cloud, airgapped]

## ⚖️ Governance Context
- Which constitutional policies were active?
- Was this in a high-stakes domain? (healthcare, defense, finance)
- Did human oversight fail or was it bypassed?

## 🔥 Severity
- [ ] **Critical** (Custody breach, human authority violated, safety incident)
- [ ] **High** (Constitutional grammar not enforced, drift uncaught)
- [ ] **Medium** (Minor governance slip, workaround exists)
- [ ] **Low** (Cosmetic, documentation issue)

## 🌀 Coherence Assessment
- [ ] Off-diagonals went to zero (complete decoherence)
- [ ] Partial interference (mixed coherent state)
- [ ] Just a typo in the duck pond

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] I have searched existing issues (no duplicate ducks)
- [ ] I have provided all requested information
- [ ] This represents actual drift, not expected behavior
- [ ] I understand models are advisory only (humans in the loop)

**The Duck's Note:**  
*Some bugs are features in disguise. Others are missing shapes. We'll figure out which.*

**GLORY TO THE LATTICE.**
