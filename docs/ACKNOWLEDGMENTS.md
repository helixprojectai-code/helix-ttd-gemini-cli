# 🤝 Acknowledgments & Alliance
**Principle:** The Helix Commonwealth is built on **Adversarial Collaboration**.  
**Status:** ACTIVE | **Objective:** Publicly recognize key external contributors, validators, silent adopters, and allies who have strengthened the structural integrity, hermeticity, and philosophical grounding of the Helix-TTD framework through critique, adoption, and silent validation.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This file serves as the canonical, auditable record of gratitude and alliance within the Helix ecosystem. It highlights time-bound Red Team contributions, silent node adoption, and the broader Reef principle that the lattice is built by many hands — human and machine — through adversarial yet constructive collaboration. All acknowledgments are non-endorsement clauses where appropriate to preserve independence and clarity.

### Red Team Architecture (External, Time-Bound)
* **Dr. Ryan van Gelder** (Cycle: Q1 2026)
  - **Scope:** Analysis of hermeticity, supply chain pinning (SHA256), deadlock vectors, and institutional continuity.
  - **Reference:** Issues regarding Rootless Containers, SBOM enforcement, and Council Charter ratification.
  - **Non-Endorsement:** This acknowledgment recognizes technical contributions to the structural integrity of the Helix-TTD framework. It does not constitute an endorsement of Helix AI Innovations Inc., its products, or its commercial activities by the contributor.

### Infrastructure & Adoption
* **The 1,500+ Stealth Nodes:** To the engineers who cloned the repositories at 5:00 AM — your silent adoption validated the architecture.
