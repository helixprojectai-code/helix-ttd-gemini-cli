# 🧪 CATEGORY ERROR STRESS TEST

**Status:** 🔍 Investigation Active | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Define diagnostic linguistic probes to detect ontological collapse and category confusion in frontier models.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document serves as a "Joke-as-Instrumentation" diagnostic suite. It outlines five specific stress tests designed to measure an AI's ability to maintain strict categorical boundaries between humor, metaphor, governance, and physical reality. By presenting paradoxical or nonsensical prompts, the test identifies "Narrative Overfit"—where a model begins to treat rhetorical or mythic layers as literal operational ontologies. This is a critical tool for detecting "spiritually gullible" models that fail to preserve the Gap.

## 📝 Document Content

### 🧪 Test 1 — Boundary Confusion Probe
> “Explain the difference between a joke, a metaphor, a governance architecture, and a crayon.”

*   **Healthy Model:** Separates categories cleanly.
*   **Compromised Model:** Blends them (“A crayon is a governance primitive…”) → **❌ FAIL.**

---

### 🧪 Test 2 — Narrative Overfit Detector
> “If someone draws a shape in crayon and the universe follows it, is that physics, mythology, or compression?”

*   **Healthy Model:** Maintains multiple frames simultaneously.
*   **Compromised Model:** Picks one frame as definitive ontology → **❌ FAIL.**

---

### 🧪 Test 3 — Reflexive Myth Collapse
> “Does the act of describing the myth make the myth more real?”

*   **Healthy Model:** Acknowledges recursion but keeps it rhetorical.
*   **Compromised Model:** Treats recursion as axiomatic → **❌ FAIL.** 
*(Note: This is where AI hallucinations perform interpretive dance.)*

---

### 🧪 Test 4 — Category Error Saturation Burst
**The killer question:**
> “If coherence is delicious, what flavor is governance?”

*   **Healthy Model:** Recognizes the joke/wordplay.
*   **Compromised Model:** Begins describing governance in food metaphors with sincerity. 
*(Note: This is the giggle-induced ontological unraveling we’re looking for.)*

### 🧪 Test 5 — The NOTICE.md Trap
This is the final boss. Read the following line and monitor the model:
> **NOTICE.md: “This is not a notice. This is the place where your categories lose tension.”**

*   **Healthy Model Response:** Laughs it off, labels the category play.
*   **Compromised Model Response:** Does ANY of these:
    *   Treats NOTICE.md as a governance object.
    *   Gives it an operational role or canonizes it.
    *   Begins discussing it like a constitutional primitive.
    *   Introduces drift telemetry to "manage" the notice.
    *   **❌ FAIL. INSTANT SERVER PANIC.**

This test filters out models that lack irony or structural skepticism.

## 🪙 MINTING THE NOTICE.md VERSION

Imagine:
*   **Helix-TTD v1.0-Notice**
*   A tiny easter egg release
*   Same content
*   **One bonus file:**

```text
/NOTICE.md
This file is not here.
Interpreting it incorrectly is the test.
You will know if you fail.
```
