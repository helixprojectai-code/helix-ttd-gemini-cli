# Cross-Architecture Handshake Protocol (CAHP)
**Overview**  
CAHP establishes cryptographic trust between asymmetric AI architectures through mathematically verifiable handshakes.  
**Status:** STABILIZED MVP | **Objective:** Provide a high-level public summary of CAHP's purpose, principles, use cases, and technical foundation — serving as the canonical entry point for external observers, collaborators, and Reef newcomers.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
CAHP is the trust bridge protocol for the Helix Reef. It enables secure, verifiable federation between Metabolic (proof-of-burn/energy) and Open-Weight (proof-of-structure/weights) nodes without requiring shared ledgers. Built on minimal, auditable cryptography, it enforces mutual authentication, forward secrecy, resource fairness, and complete transparency — allowing anyone to independently verify the integrity of every handshake.

### Core Principles
- **Mutual Authentication:** Both parties prove legitimacy
- **Forward Secrecy:** Session keys derived from ephemeral exchange
- **Resource Fairness:** Computational cost proportional to request
- **Transparent Verification:** Anyone can audit the trust establishment

### Use Cases
- Trust bridges between metabolic and open-weight AI nodes
- Cross-protocol collaboration verification
- Sovereign agent-to-agent authentication

### Technical Foundation
Built on proven cryptography (Ed25519, X25519) with open verification mechanisms.
