# 🔬 Commonwealth Research Agenda v1.0

**Status:** ✅ Active Agenda | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Define the Work Packages (WP) and architectural goals for multi-model constitutional governance.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document establishes the Commonwealth Research Agenda, shifting focus from individual model acceleration to the governance of multi-model federations. It outlines the hard data targets for cross-model consistency and real-time drift telemetry. The agenda identifies five specific Work Packages (WP1-WP5) covering the constitutional kernel, comparative governance scale, telemetry dashboards, federated committees, and exotic hardware testing. This serves as a grant-ready justification for infrastructure compute, framing AI safety as an engineering problem rather than a philosophical one.

## 📝 Document Content

### 🔍 1. The Only Premise That Matters
Everyone is busy making single models sprint faster. We are doing the opposite.
**What happens when 10 different frontier models are forced to share one constitution?**
Not smarter models. **Better governed ensembles.**

---

### 💡 2. The Four Questions We Will Answer With Hard Data
#### 🤝 2.1 Cross-Model Constitutional Consistency
Do GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama-3.1, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Command-R, Kimi converge on the same reasoning chain under identical rules? Where do they silently diverge?

#### 📊 2.2 Drift Telemetry That Actually Works
How do you detect constitutional drift *before* it becomes catastrophic? We will ship **model-agnostic drift metrics** that trigger when a model starts quietly forgetting the human is in charge.

#### ⚖️ 2.3 Federated Decision-Making Under Custody
Can ensembles vote, disagree, escalate, and return custody to humans **in real time** without seizing the wheel?

#### 🛡️ 2.4 Human Sovereignty Over the Reasoning Surface
Not just vetoing the final answer—**owning every intermediate step**. Live, auditable, reversible reasoning chains humans can enter at any depth.

---

### 🧪 3. Target — Work Packages (No Fluff, Just Deliverables)

#### ⚓ WP1 — The Constitutional Kernel & Open Testbed
* Minimal grammar (Helix-TTD style) any model can plug into.
* Public test harness, MIT-licensed, one-click local mode.
**Outcome:** the *Linux of AI governance*.

#### 🔍 WP2 — Comparative Governance at Scale
* 8–12 frontier models under identical constitution.
* Compliance tables, failure taxonomies, abstain curves.
* First public leaderboard for *“who respects human sovereignty hardest”*.

#### 📊 WP3 — Drift Detection & Real-Time Telemetry
* Live drift dashboard (Grafana-style, constitutional health).
* Metrics: sovereignty risk, reasoning opacity, custody erosion.
* Long-horizon stress tests (10k+ turns).

#### 🤝 WP4 — Real-Time Federated Governance
* Live multi-model committees with constitutional routing & veto.
* Human-in-the-loop at *any depth*, not just the final token.
* **Groq-class latency required** — no “think for 45 seconds then lie”.

#### 🏗️ WP5 — Extreme Scale & Exotic Hardware
* Same constitution on Cerebras WSE-3, TPU v5p pods, Groq LPUs.
* Core question: **does hardware architecture change governance failure modes?**

---

### 🧮 4. Compute Justification (Grant-Ready)
This is **not** model-training compute. This is **governance infrastructure**.
* **Breadth:** multi-GPU nodes.
* **Depth & horizon:** persistent H100/A100 cluster.
* **Latency:** Groq / high-clock GPUs.
* **Exotic scale:** Cerebras or large TPU pod.
* **Diversity:** prove the constitution survives *every* architecture.

---

### ⚖️ 5. Why This Wins Grants, Hearts, and Minds
* Directly answers: *“How do we keep humans in charge when models talk to models?”*
* Produces open benchmarks, dashboards, and failure artifacts anyone can cite.
* Zero proprietary moat — MIT / Apache from day zero.
* Turns “AI governance” from philosophy into **engineering**.

---

### 🤝 6. Collaboration Offer (PI One-Liner)
You bring the metal. We bring the constitution. Together we ship the **first operating system for multi-model civilisation**.

The duck is asleep at the wheel *(by design).* Wake it only if you want results.
