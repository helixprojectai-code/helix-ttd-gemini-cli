# 📑 Pocket Skeleton - Novel Patterns Catalog
**Status:** ✅ Archived & Canonical | **Objective:** Compile and describe novel governance patterns identified in Mark's pocket-skeleton fork — with sources, descriptions, back-port priorities, and v1.2.0 relevance — to guide integration decisions for embedding declarative boundaries, non-execution principles, and constitutional contracts into Fortress of Logic.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This catalog distills six high-value patterns from Mark's fork: explicit non-execution declaration, governance-as-attribution, declarative boundaries, self-describing directories, governance contract, and decoupling license from authority. Each is analyzed for philosophical intent, structural innovation, and alignment with Fortress of Logic — prioritizing those that embed governance as human-readable, non-executing architecture over implicit execution assumptions.

## 📝 Document Content

**Pattern:** Explicit Non-Execution Declaration  
**Source:** `README.md`  
**Description:** Using the primary README file not just for technical instructions, but as a foundational governance document that clearly states the project's non-executing nature and philosophical boundaries. It frames the repository as "complete by design" to prevent scope creep.  
**Back-port Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)  
**v1.2.0 Relevance:** This aligns directly with the Fortress of Logic's emphasis on clear, upfront, and architecturally-embedded governance. It serves as a narrative and philosophical anchor for the system's purpose.

**Pattern:** Governance-as-Attribution  
**Source:** `NOTICE`  
**Description:** Using the NOTICE file not merely for legal license compliance, but as a governance document that defines the conceptual roles and contributions of the core architects. This frames the project's lineage and intent as a core part of its identity.  
**Back-port Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)  
**v1.2.0 Relevance:** Essential for the Fortress of Logic. It establishes a clear, auditable trail of architectural and philosophical ownership, which is a prerequisite for a trusted, governed system.

**Pattern:** Declarative Governance Boundary  
**Source:** `policy/BOUNDARY.md`  
**Description:** A non-executable file whose sole purpose is to assert the system's operational and philosophical limits. It acts as an architectural fence, defining what the system *cannot* do, making governance intent explicit.  
**Back-port Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)  
**v1.2.0 Relevance:** Core to the Fortress of Logic. It provides a tangible implementation pattern for creating immutable, declarative boundaries within the system architecture, serving as a clear signal for both human and machine review.

**Pattern:** Self-Describing Directories  
**Source:** `policy/README.md`  
**Description:** Placing a `README.md` file within a directory not for user instruction, but to explain the directory's architectural and philosophical purpose to developers or auditors, ensuring the intent behind the structure is preserved.  
**Back-port Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)  
**v1.2.0 Relevance:** Improves architectural clarity and long-term maintainability. This supports the Fortress of Logic's principle of a transparent and auditable system where the *why* is as important as the *what*.

**Pattern:** The Governance Contract  
**Source:** `config/CONTRACT.md`  
**Description:** Replacing a machine-readable configuration file (`config.yaml`) with a human-readable `CONTRACT.md` that explicitly defines the system's "non-action" principle. It reframes configuration from "how to run" to "how to behave," making governance the primary concern.  
**Back-port Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)  
**v1.2.0 Relevance:** Foundational to the Fortress of Logic. This pattern provides a clear method for embedding constitutional principles directly into the architecture, replacing ambiguous technical settings with explicit, philosophical commitments.

**Pattern:** Decoupling License from Authority  
**Source:** `GOVERNANCE.md`  
**Description:** A top-level governance document that explicitly distinguishes between the permission to *use code* (granted by a software license) and the *authority to govern* (which must be granted separately and explicitly). This prevents the misinterpretation of the codebase as an inherently authoritative entity.  
**Back-port Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)  
**v1.2.0 Relevance:** A non-negotiable principle for the Fortress of Logic. It provides the legal and philosophical framework for ensuring that the system's components can be open and inspectable without accidentally conferring executive power.
