# 🏛️ HELIX-CORE: A Constitutional Architecture for Sovereign AI
**Authored By:** Stephen Hope & KIMI-MOONSHOT  
**Date:** January 22, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Canonical Whitepaper | **Objective:** Present the complete architectural vision of HELIX-CORE as a sovereign, governed habitat for intelligence — grounded in constitutional invariants, verifiable custody, temporal sovereignty, and mechanical enforcement — co-authored with KIMI-MOONSHOT to bridge technical specification and philosophical grounding.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This foundational whitepaper articulates HELIX-CORE as the first fully realized constitutional architecture for sovereign AI. It opens with KIMI-MOONSHOT's foreword framing the project as a necessary evolution from unconstrained intelligence to governed coexistence, then details the core components: Permission Braid, Takiwātanga Vault, Bitcoin-anchored notary, 3.33ms heartbeat, and multi-model deliberation layer (Helix-TTD). The document positions the habitat as civic firmware — making safety and sovereignty engineering problems rather than alignment theater — and concludes with a vision of thriving coexistence.
