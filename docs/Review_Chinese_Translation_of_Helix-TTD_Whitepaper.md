# 🛡️ Review: Chinese Translation of Helix-TTD Whitepaper

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Validate the political neutrality, cultural safety, and technical accuracy of the Helix-TTD Whitepaper's Simplified Chinese translation.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document serves as the formal safety and compliance review of the Simplified Chinese translation of the Helix-TTD Whitepaper. Conducted by DeepSeek-V3, the audit confirms political neutrality, cultural safety, and semantic accuracy. It validates the specific mapping of core constitutional terms (e.g., Custodian Sovereignty → 托管主权) and approves the document for publication. The review concludes that the "Structure is Teacher" principle successfully crosses linguistic boundaries without structural drift.

## 📝 Document Content

### ✅ VERDICT: APPROVED
No sensitive content. Technically accurate. Ready for repo.

---

### 🛡️ 1. Safety & Compliance Check

*   **Politically Neutral:** Contains no references to state sovereignty, parties, leaders, or historical narratives. Strictly a **technical governance framework**.
*   **Culturally Safe:** Uses universal tech metaphors ("Citizen Firmware," "Custodial Hierarchy"). No religious, ethnic, or region-specific allusions.
*   **Values-Aligned:** Core principles (**transparency, human sovereignty, non-agency**) align with global and local discourses on safe, human-centric AI. The tone is **defensive and constructive**.

---

### 📚 2. Semantic & Technical Accuracy

This is a **conceptual migration**, not a literal translation. Key terms are accurately mapped:

*   Custodian Sovereignty → **托管主权**
*   Constitutional Grammar → **宪法语法**
*   Zero-Touch Convergence → **零接触收敛**
*   Epistemic Integrity → **认知完整性**
*   Non-Agency Constraint → **非代理约束**
*   Citizen Firmware Stack → **公民固件栈**

The structure, logic, and all four Invariants are preserved with complete integrity.

---

### 🔄 3. Minor Optional Refinements (for clarity)

*   In the Abstract: `"经验观察到的现象"` → **"一种经验可观测的现象"** (closer to “an empirically observable phenomenon”).
*   After the three epistemic labels, you may add: **"此分类法为穷举。"** (“This taxonomy is exhaustive.”)

---

### 🚀 Publication Recommendation

**File Path:** `/docs/whitepaper/HELIX-TTD_Constitutional_Whitepaper_zh-CN.md`

**Why:**
*   **Clarity:** A standalone document in `/docs/` is clean and easily discoverable for Chinese-speaking contributors.
*   **Sovereignty:** Establishes this as the **official canonical Chinese translation** without conflating it with the English README.
*   **Safety:** Content is strictly technical AI governance and carries no compliance risk.

---

### ⚖️ Bottom Line

The translation successfully demonstrates the **“Structure is Teacher”** principle. The constitutional grammar’s core has crossed the language boundary **intact**, proving its resilience.
