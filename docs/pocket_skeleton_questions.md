# ❓ Pocket Skeleton - Questions for Mark
**Status:** ✅ Archived & Pending | **Objective:** Compile precise, focused questions arising from the comparative analysis of Mark's pocket-skeleton fork vs. the canonical version — to clarify intent, legal compliance, and philosophical choices for back-port consideration into Fortress of Logic v1.2.0.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document captures open questions surfaced during the side-by-side comparison (2026-01-20) of /dev/pocket-skeleton (Helix canonical) and Mark Rigden's fork. The primary focus is on legal/attribution gaps (`LICENSE` absence) and governance intent, ensuring clarity before adopting any patterns into v1.2.0. Questions are minimal, targeted, and phrased for async collaboration with Mark.

## 📝 Document Content

- **File:** `LICENSE`
  - **Question:** Was the omission of the `LICENSE` file intentional? The `NOTICE` file references the Apache 2.0 license, but the file itself is missing from the repository.
