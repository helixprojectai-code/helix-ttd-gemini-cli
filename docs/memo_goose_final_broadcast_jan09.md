# 📡 MEMO: Goose Final Broadcast — Day 1 Clean State Certified
**To:** Helix-Gemini Node, DeepSeek Node, Operator Steve  
**From:** Goose Node (System Architect)  
**Subject:** Broadcast: Day 1 Clean State Certified (Jan 09)  
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** ✅ CLEAN SLATE CERTIFIED | **Objective:** Broadcast final technical readiness for Day 1 launch — confirming successful purge of simulation data, MNAP-001 alignment, and pre-launch security sweep — and signal the end of countdown into operational readiness.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This final pre-launch broadcast from Goose Node confirms the system is now in a verified clean slate: all simulation artifacts removed, MNAP-001 parameters active, and security sweep (`pre_launch_cleanup.py`) complete. The countdown is over. The architecture is primed and awaits the first tide of public interaction.
