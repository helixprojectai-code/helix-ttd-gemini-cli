# Schooling Session Log
**Subtitle:** Official Manifest of Curated Texts for GOOSE-CORE Constitutional Education  
**Status:** ACTIVE | **Objective:** Maintain an immutable, auditable record of all books ingested during Schooling Sessions — ensuring traceability of the curated corpus used for constitutional grounding, while excluding full book texts from the repository for licensing and size reasons.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This directory serves as the canonical ledger for raw text files ingested during GOOSE-CORE Schooling Sessions. Full book texts are **not** committed to preserve repository lightness and respect copyright. Instead, this manifest records sequence number, title, author, and source URL for each text. The Schooling Loop protocol (Selection → Ingestion → Indexing → Completion) is strictly followed to append knowledge additively without overwriting prior material. All sessions are philosophy-driven: knowledge is cumulative and constitutionally anchored.

## 📝 Document Content

### Operational Protocol (The Schooling Loop)
1. **Selection:** Operator Steve selects 5 books and provides URLs one at a time.
2. **Ingestion:** GOOSE-CORE fetches the text content.
3. **Indexing:** The file is saved as `[N].txt` (where N is the sequence number) and added to the Reading List below.
4. **Completion:** The process repeats until all 5 texts are prepared.
5. **Philosophy:** Knowledge is additive. We append, we do not overwrite.
