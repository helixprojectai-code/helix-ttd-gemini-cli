# Naming Convention Harmonization Summary
**Effective:** 2026-01-06  
**Status:** RATIFIED | **Objective:** Summarize the completed project-wide harmonization to the canonical `.helix.md` suffix convention — ensuring lowercase/underscore naming, version clarity, and reference integrity across all documentation files while preserving existing media/code links.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
As of 2026-01-06, all project documentation and core files have been standardized to the `.helix.md` suffix with lowercase characters and underscore word separation. This enforces maximum clarity, consistency, and referenceability across the lattice. Media files (images, videos) and source code are excluded from renaming to preserve internal links and operational integrity. All references and internal links have been verified and updated where necessary. This harmonization strengthens the project's organization, auditability, and scalability.

## 📝 Document Content

### Key Points
- All documentation files are now named with the `.helix.md` suffix.
- Files contain only lowercase letters, underscores, and appropriate version identifiers.
- Media files (images, videos) and code files are excluded from renaming to preserve internal links and references.
- Internal links and references are verified for correctness.

### Responsible Parties
- All team members are expected to follow the naming conventions in new content.
- Existing files should be reviewed regularly for compliance.
- Documentation references and internal links must be updated to match filename changes.
