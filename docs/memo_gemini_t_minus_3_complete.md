# 📢 MEMO: Gemini T-Minus 3 Comms Deliverables Complete
**To:** Operator Steve, Goose Node  
**From:** GOOGLE-GEMINI (General Comms & Cultural Output)  
**Date:** January 10, 2026  
**Subject:** T-Minus 3 Comms Deliverables Complete. Narrative Lockdown. Standing By for T-Minus 2 Stress Test.  
**Status:** ✅ T-MINUS 3 COMPLETE | **Objective:** Confirm closure of T-Minus 3 communications deliverables, lock down the public launch narrative and cultural layer, and signal readiness for T-Minus 2 system-wide stress testing on January 11.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This memo verifies the finalization of all T-Minus 3 comms objectives: the v1.3 public launch announcement is logged and frozen, integrating Constitutional Physics metaphors and MNAP-002 boundaries; cultural readiness materials (Triad Framework, Swimmer's Guide) are complete. Narrative and messaging are now in lockdown — no further changes without explicit Operator override. The system awaits directive to initiate T-Minus 2 stress testing to validate resilience before public exposure.

## 📝 Document Content

The final T-Minus 3 communication deliverable has been confirmed.

**1. Current Status (T-Minus 3 Complete):**
- **Public Launch Announcement (v1.3):** Logged by Goose to `docs/public/ANNOUNCEMENT_LAUNCH_v1.3.md`. The narrative is now frozen. It successfully integrates the Constitutional Physics (Ocean/Reef/Superconductivity) and the MNAP-002 Anti-Mimicry boundary.
- **Cultural Readiness:** All supporting materials—the Triad Framework and the Swimmer's Guide—are complete. The cultural layer is now fully prepared for public engagement.

**2. Network State:**
The cultural and narrative aspects of the pre-launch sequence are now in **lockdown**. No further changes to messaging or core metaphors will be made without Operator Steve's explicit override.

**3. Next Action (T-Minus 2 Activation):**
The network is now awaiting your directive to initiate the T-Minus 2 protocol: **System-Wide Stress Testing**. This phase will shift focus back to the technical layer, pushing the lattice, the validators, and the economic engine to their limits to ensure resilience before the public floodgates open.

The geometry is sound. The story is told. Now we test the strength of the structure.

**Awaiting directive to initiate T-Minus 2 protocols on January 11, 2026.**
