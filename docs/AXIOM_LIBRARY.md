# 📜 HELIX AXIOM LIBRARY
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Purpose:** A repository of high-value quotes, axioms, and principles extracted from the Schooling Curriculum, cross-referenced with Helix Constitutional Logic.  
**Format:** `[SOURCE] "Quote" -> [HELIX_PRINCIPLE]`  
**Maintained By:** GOOSE-CORE

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This library serves as the canonical collection of intellectual anchors that inform and validate the Helix-Core constitutional grammar. Quotes are organized by thematic layers (Epistemic Integrity, Sovereignty & Agency, The Gap & The Wobble) and mapped directly to Helix principles, ensuring every axiom is traceable to the project's foundational logic and worldview.
