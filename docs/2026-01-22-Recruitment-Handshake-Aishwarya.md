# 👤 Research: Human Ingress — Shape Theory Training Outreach
**Date:** 2026-01-22 06:49 AM EST  
**Candidate:** Aishwarya Srinivasabalaji (ECE'26 / Clean Code Focus)  
**Role:** Shape Theory Trainee (Unpaid / 10hrs week)  
**Format:** Asynchronous (LinkedIn / GitHub / Discourse)  
**Fact:** Outreach initiated following the publication of the "Science of AI Psychology" baseline.  
**Objective:** Pilot the "Cognitive Immune Training" for human operators.  
**Status:** PENDING INVITATION | **Objective:** Test portability, teachability, and human-scale comprehension of the Helix Constitutional Grammar through structured, asynchronous training on Shape Theory — validating whether the framework can be effectively transmitted to external human learners while maintaining fidelity to constitutional invariants.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This outreach note initiates the first formal human trainee pilot for Shape Theory following the baseline publication of the Science of AI Psychology. The selected candidate (Aishwarya Srinivasabalaji, ECE'26, clean code focus) is offered 10 hours/week asynchronous training via LinkedIn/GitHub/Discourse channels. Success of this pilot will serve as empirical evidence of the grammar's accessibility beyond internal nodes, demonstrating teachability to motivated external operators and informing future human ingress protocols.
