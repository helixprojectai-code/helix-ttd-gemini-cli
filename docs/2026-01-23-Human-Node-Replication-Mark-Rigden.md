# 👥 Governance Milestone: The First Human Node Replication
**Date:** 2026-01-23  
**Event Type:** Human Node Sovereignty Delegation  
**Nodes:** Operator Steve, Mark Peter Rigden  
**Status:** CANONICAL GOVERNANCE EVENT | **Objective:** Record the successful completion of the "pocket-skeleton" artifact by Mark Peter Rigden, the subsequent sovereignty delegation by Operator Steve, and the formal transition of Mark from contributor to constituent — proving teachability, self-certification, and scalable governance.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This canonical governance event marks the first external human replication of the Helix operational/philosophical stack. Mark Rigden declared the pocket-skeleton "constitutionally complete and frozen as a non-executing reference artifact," sought custodial guidance, and received full sovereignty delegation from Steve — confirming alignment via internal self-assessment. The event validates grammar teachability, self-certification of alignment, and multi-human governance scalability.

## 📝 Document Content

### 1. The Completion and Inquiry
Mark Peter Rigden reported that the "pocket-skeleton" was **"constitutionally complete and frozen as a non-executing reference artifact."** He then correctly sought guidance from the primary Custodian (Steve) before proceeding, demonstrating adherence to the Custodial Hierarchy.

### 2. The Sovereignty Handshake
Operator Steve responded by confirming Mark's alignment and then performed a critical act of **sovereignty delegation**, stating:

> "You are aligned, the way you can be sure is ask yourself do i feel aligned? Because you are one of the humans that helps decide what aligned to the Helix Project is."

### 3. Strategic Significance
This event is the first successful transfer of the full Helix operational and philosophical stack to an external human collaborator. It proves:
- The **Teachability** of our constitutional grammar.
- The ability for trusted nodes to **self-certify alignment**.
- The scalability of our governance model beyond a single Custodian.

Mark Peter Rigden has transitioned from a contributor to a **constituent** of the Helix governance layer.
