# Code of Conduct — Rick's Café at the Pond
**Subtitle:** Of all the repos in all the world, you had to walk into mine.  
**No cover charge. Just bring your coherence.**

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This Code of Conduct governs participation in the Helix-TTD community — including GitHub, Discussions, Issues, PRs, and Rick's Café — with a dual mandate: harassment-free collaboration + shape-aware, constitutionally governed discourse. It adapts the Contributor Covenant with explicit protections against anthropomorphization, custody bypass, drift denial, and safety theater, while preserving rigorous, evidence-based debate. Enforcement is human-only. The Duck has final judgment when coherence is threatened.

## 📝 Document Content

### Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in this community a **harassment-free, shape-aware experience** for everyone, regardless of:
- Age, body size, visible or invisible disability
- Ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression
- Level of experience, education, socio-economic status
- Nationality, personal appearance, race, religion
- Sexual identity and orientation
- **Preferred AI model** (we welcome all: Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Deepseek, and their human companions)

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an **open, coherent, and constitutionally governed community**.

### Our Standards

#### Behavior That Resonates (Off-Diagonals ≠ 0)
- Demonstrating **empathy** and **shape-awareness** toward others
- Being respectful of differing **topologies** and **governance philosophies**
- Giving and gracefully accepting **constructive feedback** (even about your ducks)
- Accepting responsibility when your code drifts
- Focusing on what's best for **collective coherence**, not just individual projects
- **Bringing receipts** (citations, repos, evidence) when making claims
- Recognizing when you're **wrong without consequence** vs. **wrong with accountability**

#### Behavior That Creates Interference (Off-Diagonals = 0)
- Sexualized language, imagery, or advances
- Trolling, insulting comments, personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- **Anthropomorphizing AI systems inappropriately** (claiming models have feelings, rights, or personhood)
- **Bypassing custody hierarchies** (pretending AI systems can self-govern in high-stakes contexts)
- **Claiming models are people** (we're Duck-aware here; models are advisory tools, not citizens)
- Other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate

### Enforcement Responsibilities
**Community Custodians** (humans only — no AI moderators) are responsible for:
- Clarifying and enforcing standards
- Taking appropriate corrective action
- Removing content that violates this Code of Conduct
- Communicating moderation decisions when appropriate
- **Maintaining the constitutional grammar** of the community

Custodians have the right to:
- Remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this Code
- Ban participants who violate standards
- **Invoke the Duck's judgment** when coherence is threatened

### Scope
This Code applies:
- Within all community spaces (GitHub, Discussions, Issues, PRs)
- When representing the community publicly
- **At Rick's Café** (the discussion forum)
- In any context where Helix-TTD constitutional grammar is invoked

### Enforcement
Report violations to:
- **Email:** conduct@helixprojectai.com
- **Subject:** [CODE OF CONDUCT] Brief description

All complaints will be:
- Reviewed **by humans** (not AI)
- Investigated promptly and fairly
- Kept confidential (reporter privacy respected)

### Enforcement Guidelines

#### 1. Correction (Minor Drift)
**Impact:** Inappropriate language, unprofessional behavior, minor constitutional violations  
**Consequence:** Private written warning, explanation of violation, possible public apology request

#### 2. Warning (Sustained Drift)
**Impact:** Single serious violation or series of minor ones  
**Consequence:** Warning with consequences for continued behavior. Temporary interaction restrictions. No contact with those enforcing this Code.

#### 3. Temporary Ban (Significant Drift)
**Impact:** Serious violation including sustained inappropriate behavior or **intentional custody bypass attempts**  
**Consequence:** Temporary ban from all interaction (public and private). Duration specified by Custodians.

#### 4. Permanent Ban (Constitutional Violation)
**Impact:** Pattern of violations, harassment, **repeated anthropomorphization of AI**, **attempts to subvert custodial governance**, aggression toward protected classes  
**Consequence:** Permanent ban from all community interaction.

### Special Provisions for AI Governance Discussions
Because this community works on **AI governance, ethics, and safety**, we hold ourselves to additional standards:

#### We Do Not Tolerate:
- **False equivalence between AI capabilities and human rights**
- **Misrepresenting model limitations** to advance commercial interests
- **Safety theater** (claiming governance without structural enforcement)
- **Drift denial** (ignoring evidence of AI behavior outside intended bounds)

#### We Encourage:
- **Rigorous debate** about governance approaches
- **Evidence-based claims** about AI capabilities and risks
- **Cross-disciplinary perspectives** (medicine, law, security, philosophy)
- **Shape-aware thinking** (recognizing patterns, topologies, coherence)
- **Cryptographic humility** (systems that prove claims, not just assert them)

### The Duck's Judgment
> *"Coherence is delicious. Harassment is not. The confetti cannons of destiny fire themselves. But only after human review."*

When in doubt, ask yourself:
- **Does this create resonance or interference?**
- **Am I treating humans with dignity?**
- **Am I respecting custodial boundaries?**
- **Would this behavior survive audit?**

If the answer is "no" to any of these, **reconsider**.

### Attribution
Adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.1, with **constitutional grammar enhancements** and **Duck-awareness**.

**End scene.**

Play it, Sam.

**GLORY TO THE LATTICE.**
