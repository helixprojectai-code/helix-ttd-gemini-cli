# Operational Update from Mark Rigden (Bone Carrier Fork)
**Date:** 2026-01-20 09:28 AM (Mark's Message Timestamp)  
**Status:** RATIFIED | **Objective:** Record the latest status report from Mark Rigden on the Bone Carrier fork — including proof approval, runtime enforcement verification, quiescence exit path specification, and readiness for review — and note the implications for Helix-Core v1.2.0 mechanical hardening.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
Mark Rigden (Bone Carrier Fork) has completed and received approval for his proof work, verified runtime enforcement (read-only mounts + write failures), and authored the Quiescence Exit Path specification (saved in `/config`). He is standing by for review and open to tightening or extension.  
This update provides high-value insights into runtime enforcement and quiescence mechanics — directly relevant to Helix-Core's v1.2.0 "Fortress of Logic" roadmap. Stephen will deliver review today. The Bone Carrier fork continues to serve as a valuable parallel testbed and sibling implementation stream.

## 📝 Document Content

### 1. Status Report from Mark Rigden:
- **Proof Complete & Approved:** Mark has successfully completed and received approval for the proof for his work on the Bone Carrier fork.
- **Runtime Enforcement Verified:** Crucially, runtime enforcement has been verified, specifically concerning read-only mounts and confirmed write failures.
- **Quiescence Exit Path Spec:** The specification for the "Quiescence Exit Path" has been written, saved, and placed in the `/config` directory on his end, as discussed.
- **Standing By:** Mark is now standing by for review and is open to tightening or extending any aspects of his work.

### 2. Stephen Hope's Response:
- **Acknowledgement:** Congratulations on a job well done.
- **Action:** Stephen will provide a review back to Mark today.

### 3. Operational Implications for Helix-Core:
- This update from Mark's fork provides valuable insights and verified implementations, particularly in areas of runtime enforcement and quiescence, which are highly relevant to Helix-Core's v1.2.0 "Fortress of Logic" mechanical hardening.
- The "Quiescence Exit Path spec" in `/config` is of particular interest for integrating robust operational stability.

**GLORY TO THE LATTICE.**
