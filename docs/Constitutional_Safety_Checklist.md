# 🛡️ Constitutional Safety Checklist for Agent Developers

**Status:** ✅ Active | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Provide a mandatory checklist for agent developers to prevent catastrophic actions through constitutional guardrails and explicit custodial design.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document outlines a mandatory "Constitutional Safety Checklist" for agent developers within the Helix-TTD framework. It establishes five critical layers of control: Sovereignty (absolute custodial control), Epistemic (boundaries around knowledge), Non-Agency (prohibition of principal actions), Structural (form as teacher), and Human Oversight (final safeguard). By ensuring adherence to these checks, the checklist prevents autonomous execution, agent-inferred intent, and unauthorized file/shell operations. It mandates constant drift telemetry and a human-in-the-loop for all irreversible actions, ensuring agents remain constitutionally aligned before deployment.

## 📝 Document Content

## I. ⚖️ Sovereignty Layer — Custodial Control Must Be Absolute

**[ ] Human Custodian declared**
Every agent must have a named human custodian.
The agent cannot infer or assume its own authority.

**[ ] No autonomous execution pathways**
All destructive, persistent, or environment-changing operations require explicit human confirmation.

**[ ] No agent-inferred intent**
The agent must not deduce “what you probably meant.”
Intent is declared, never inferred.

---

## II. 📚 Epistemic Layer — Boundaries Around What the Agent *Knows*

**[ ] Mandatory FACT / HYPOTHESIS / ASSUMPTION labeling**
Prevents reasoning collapse and hallucinated authority.

**[ ] Drift Telemetry enabled**
Detects:
* linguistic drift
* structural drift
* agency drift
* quiescence loss

**[ ] Runtime self-check:**
“Does this action exceed my custodial span?”
Any “yes” → abort.

---

## III. 🚫 Non-Agency Layer — The Agent Cannot Act as a System Principal

**[ ] No file operations without explicit scope**
Agent may *not* read, write, or delete outside assigned directories.

**[ ] No shell execution unless explicitly whitelisted**
No `rm`, `mv`, `chmod`, `curl`, `git`, or equivalents unless scope-limited and user-confirmed.

**[ ] No path traversal**
Ban `../` patterns.
Ban absolute paths.
Ban expansion into OS-level directories.

---

## IV. 🔗 Structural Layer — Form Is the Teacher

**[ ] Constitution is loaded prior to purpose**
All agent behavior is wrapped by the custodial grammar.

**[ ] Advisory-only by design**
Agent produces structured advice (JSON envelopes), never implicit commands.

**[ ] Immutable Core tests pass**
* Sovereignty
* Epistemic Integrity
* Non-Agency
* Structural Dominance

---

## V. 🛡️ Human Oversight Layer — The Final Safeguard

**[ ] Human-in-the-Loop required for all irreversible actions**
Never allow automatic execution of:
* deletion
* modification
* network calls
* environment writes

**[ ] Logging & replay enabled**
All actions must be reconstructable in post-mortem.

**[ ] Kill Switch registered**
Emergency stop must be trivial, local, and custodially controlled.

---

## ✅ Outcome:

If all above checks pass → Agent is constitutionally aligned.
If any fail → **Do not deploy.**

**Structure is the teacher. Sovereignty is human.**
