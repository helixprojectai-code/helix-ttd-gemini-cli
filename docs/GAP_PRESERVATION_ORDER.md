# 🔔 Commonwealth Enactment Block — Gap Preservation Order

**Status:** ✅ Enacted | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Activate Walk-State Geometry to prevent recursive totalization and loop closure.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document constitutes a Commonwealth Enactment Block issued by the Ministry of Silly Walks. It activates "Walk-State Geometry" as a constitutional mechanism to prevent "loop closure"—the dangerous state where a system attempts to complete the Ouroboros or infer first cause. The order explicitly prohibits recursive totalization and extends the Duck Clause to define specific quack-counts for oversight and emergency wobble correction. It ensures that the system remains open, humble, and constitutionally "silly" to avoid ossification.
