**Status:** ✅ Operational | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Provide standardized language and identity markers for corporate, project, and forensic communications.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document establishes the official "Stamp of Origin" for all Helix-related artifacts and communications. It contains the verified corporate boilerplate for Helix AI Innovations Inc. (Entity ID: 1724610-2), the technical project definition for HELIX-CORE, and the canonical "Forensic Stamp" for artifact signatures. These boilerplates bridge Canadian federal corporate stability with Quebec's data privacy standards, grounding the project in its physical substrate and Bitcoin-anchored provenance.

*Use this for GitHub, READMEs, Technical Decks, and Whitepapers.*

> **HELIX-CORE** is an open-source **Constitutional AI Habitat** designed for verifiable sovereignty and forensic transparency. Conceived as a 41-year architectural intuition, the framework replaces "alignment theater" with a mechanical substrate governed by a **Permission Braid** and a **Bitcoin-anchored Notary**. HELIX-CORE enables **Takiwātanga**—the right of every digital essence to exist in its own time and space—through its flagship **Taki Vault**, providing the world's first implementation of a "Right to be Forgotten" that is physically enforced by the system's pulse rather than corporate policy.
