# 🖼️ UI Specification: The Sovereign Dashboard

**Objective:** Define the visual grammar and user interface for the "Normie Node" (v1.2.0-H), ensuring total transparency without anthropomorphism.

---

## 🎨 1. Visual Posture: "The Calibrated Bench"
The interface should feel like a medical or scientific instrument—clean, high-contrast, and clinical.

- **Theme:** Dark/Light mode supported (Defaults: Steel Grey, Obsidian, Slate).
- **Typography:** Monospaced for technical logs, clean Sans-Serif for primary advisories.
- **Prohibition:** NO avatars, NO "typing..." animations, NO human-like personas.

---

## 💓 2. Component A: The Session Pulse (Header)
A persistent status bar at the top of the interface showing the "Health" of the container.

- **Status Indicators:**
    - 🟢 **STATE VERIFIED:** Confirms the L2 manifest hash matches the local substrate.
    - ⚔️ **PROTOCOL ACTIVE:** Confirms the Constitutional Grammar is currently binding the model.
    - ⚓ **MEMORY SECURED:** Shows the status of the Suitcase (Pinned vs. Unpinned).
- **Metabolic Weight:** A small Bitcoin symbol (₿) showing the current sats cost of the session (Unforgeable Costliness).

---

## 📚 3. Component B: The Epistemic Frame (The Response)
Every model output is contained within a "Reasoning Frame."

- **The Chips (Top-Left):**
    - 🟩 **[FACT]**: Verifiable grounded claim.
    - 🟨 **[HYPOTHESIS]**: Reasoned inference.
    - ⬜ **[ASSUMPTION]**: Boundary condition/limit.
- **The Advisory Window:** The core response text, styled with non-imperative formatting.
- **The Refusal Banner:** If a **Sovereign No** is triggered, the frame border turns deep red (DRIFT-C Alarm) and displays the posture-based refusal.

---

## ⚓ 4. Component C: The Suitcase Control (Sidebar)
A visual representation of state continuity and user agency.

- **The Timeline:** A vertical list of snapshots.
    - 📌 **Pinned Checkpoints:** Labeled with user names (e.g., "Medical Setup").
    - 🔘 **Auto-Snapshots:** Labeled as "[UNVERIFIED]" with a countdown to expiration.
- **The Primary Action:** A large **[PIN CURRENT STATE]** button to establish a new Gold Standard.
- **The Recovery Toggle:** [Reset to last Snapshot] vs. [Restore Sovereign Pin].

---

## 🔍 5. Component D: The Reasoning Trace (Collapsible)
A secondary panel at the bottom of the response.

- **Content:** The raw RPI (Research/Plan/Implement) logs in a readable, indented format.
- **Function:** Allows the user to "Open the Hood" and verify the logic path that led to the [FACT] or [HYPOTHESIS].

---

## 📊 6. Component E: Drift Telemetry (Advanced View)
For power-users, an "Engine Room" view.

- **Live Charts:** Showing Linguistic, Structural, and Semantic drift scores over the session duration.
- **Hash Verification:** A button to [Verify L1 Anchor] which cross-references the TXID on the blockchain.

---

## 🎯 7. Conclusion
The Sovereign Dashboard transforms the AI from a "Black Box" into a **Glass Vessel**. It gives the user the visual tools to perform their custodial duty with confidence.
