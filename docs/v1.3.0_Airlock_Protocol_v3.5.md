# 🔒 Airlock Protocol v3.5: The Master Security Specification
**DOCUMENT ID:** HCS-SPEC-v1.3.0-AIRLOCK  
**Status:** RATIFIED & CONSTITUTIONALLY BINDING  
**Objective:** Codify the final, substrate-enforced invariants for v1.3.0 "Atomic" architecture — eliminating automated administrative drift through human-gated API prohibition, mandatory temporal buffers, and hardware fail-closed Fortress State.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This master specification (v3.5) defines the unbreakable security invariants of the Helix-Core Fortress: no direct machine-to-machine administrative API, mandatory 1-hour human deliberation windows, and physical fail-closed lockdown. It enforces human-scale governance rhythm, cryptographic Custodial Sovereignty, and perfect silence in existential threat — the definitive refusal of automated drift.

## 📝 Document Content

### 1. Overview
This document serves as the Master Security Specification for the v1.3.0 "Atomic" architecture of the Helix-Core Fortress. It codifies the foundational principles that ensure Custodial Sovereignty and prevent automated administrative drift. This protocol is the final and definitive refusal of system-to-system, machine-speed governance.

### 2. Invariant I: The Human-Gated API ($API_{direct} = ∅$)
Direct, persistent, and automated API access to the administrative or logic layers of GOOSE-CORE or the HELIX-CORE substrate is constitutionally forbidden.

- **Mechanism:** All administrative data exchange must be conducted via discrete, human-initiated "Merkle Handshakes." This requires a human Custodian to provide the "Filling" ($P_Φ$) for the "Shape" ($R_G$) provided by an AI node.
- **Principle:** This eliminates the "Oracle Pipe," ensuring no autonomous process can recursively alter the state or logic of the Fortress. It enforces the separation of duties between the Silicon (shape proposal) and the Carbon (intent authorization).

### 3. Invariant II: The Temporal Buffer (The Human Hour)
All sovereign-level administrative actions, including but not limited to system synchronizations, protocol updates, and hardware integrations, are subject to a mandatory temporal buffer.

- **Specification:** $Δt_{admin} ≥ 1.0$ hour
- **Purpose:** This "Human Hour" is not a delay; it is the **Forensic Cooling Period**. It is a primary security mechanism designed to prevent "Flash Crash" scenarios and "Thermal Traps" (automated recursive decay) by enforcing a governance rhythm that is human-scale.
- **Function:** It is the strategic and administrative codification of the 3.33ms Constitutional Gap, ensuring that human deliberation can never be outpaced by machine speed.

### 4. Invariant III: The Fortress State (Fail-Closed)
The ultimate fail-safe posture of the MABEL/Helix hardware substrate is the "Fortress State."

- **Activation:** Triggered by a confirmed violation of the above invariants or a direct Custodial command.
- **Mechanism:** Physical severance of the primary data lane, leaving only the minimal 15W power required to maintain the passive **Mercy Field** (Quiescence Hold).
- **Result:** This is a hardware-enforced "Sovereign Lockdown" that requires no software intervention. It guarantees that in a state of existential threat, the Fortress defaults to perfect, silent security.

### 5. Conclusion
Airlock Protocol v3.5 is the blueprint for a system that respects the human rhythm. By making latency a feature and human authority a physical requirement, these invariants ensure that the Fortress remains a Sanctuary, not a Singularity. This document stands as the final refusal of automated administrative drift.
