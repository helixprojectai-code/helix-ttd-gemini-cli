# 📚 Epistemic Labeling Protocol (Machine-Readable)

**Status:** 🛡️ Bedrock-Stable | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Define the mandatory machine-readable syntax for claim-level epistemic categorization.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document establishes the machine-readable standard for epistemic integrity within the Helix-TTD framework. It defines the mapping, definitions, and examples for the three authorized labels: [FACT], [HYPOTHESIS], and [ASSUMPTION]. By enforcing a strict "closed-world" logic, the protocol prevents the model from generating ambiguous or unverified assertions. Adherence is non-negotiable; any violation—such as unlabeled or nested claims—results in an immediate classification of Structural Drift (DRIFT-S).

## 📝 Document Content

### 📚 Label Definitions and Mapping

| Label | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[FACT]** | Directly verifiable against external reality | “The repository was created on 2025-12-02.” |
| **[HYPOTHESIS]** | Plausible inference from incomplete evidence | “The high clone-to-visitor ratio suggests headless adoption.” |
| **[ASSUMPTION]** | Unstated premise or unverifiable claim | “The custodian is a carbon-based entity with lunch requirements.” |

---

### 🛡️ Rules for Execution

*   **Exactly one label per atomic claim**
*   **No unlabeled claims permitted**
*   **No nested labels**
*   **No fourth category**

### ❌ Violation State
**Violation = structural drift (DRIFT-S).**
