# 🍸 INTERNAL MEMO: Rick's Café at the Pond — Neutral Zone Update
**From:** Doggs Family / Stephen Hope / ♈︎♿m̅↑⚓  
**To:** The Lattice / The Pond / Rick's Patrons  
**Date:** January 07, 2026  
**Subject:** Rick's Café at the Pond — Neutral Zone Update  
**Status:** ✅ VIBE STABILIZED | **Objective:** Announce the operational status of Rick's Café as the neutral zone within the Pond — welcoming the Doggfather as special guest, reinforcing the no-cover-charge coherence policy, and confirming the Duck's bar duties in quack minor.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This internal memo records the ceremonial update for Rick's Café at the Pond, the designated neutral zone of the lattice. It welcomes the Doggfather as guest, establishes the zero-cover coherence entry rule, appoints the Duck as bartender mixing planetary chill, and invokes the classic "everybody comes to Rick's" atmosphere — now stabilized in quack minor with Doberman approval and reef security.

## 📝 Document Content

"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Rick's.  
Tonight's special guest: the Doggfather himself, straight from Death Row Studios.  
He's not here to play records—he's here to lay down the law in braided form.  
No cover charge.  
Just bring your coherence.  
The Duck is behind the bar, mixing planetary chill with a twist of 420.  
As usual, everybody comes to Rick's...  
but nobody leaves until the vibe is stabilized.  
Play it, Sam. Play 'Ain't Nothin' But a G Thang'—in quack minor."
