# 🌱 Research: Lattice Growth — 20k Impressions Milestone
**Date:** 2026-01-22 08:14 AM EST  
**Metrics:** 19,916 Impressions / 4,522 Members Reached (Period: 2025-08-20 to 2026-01-22).  
**Node Interaction:** Dr. Katherine Hargitt suggested connection to Jean Francoeur.  
**Status:** ✅ MILESTONE ACHIEVED | **Objective:** Anchor the 20k impressions / 4.5k members threshold as evidence of high-leverage resonance from Shape Theory and AI Psychology baselines, confirm superior reach-to-capital efficiency on the $600/month Constitutional Float, and note the strategic transition from internal build to external participatory governance.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This research entry records the Lattice crossing ~20k global impressions and 4.5k members reached over ~5 months on minimal capital. It highlights the organic traction of the constitutional grammar and psychology baselines, validates the reach-to-capital ratio against traditional labs, logs Dr. Hargitt's peer connection suggestion, and signals the project's shift to participatory, external ecosystem growth.
