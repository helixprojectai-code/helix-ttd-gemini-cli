# ⚓ Q₃: Anchor Strike — The Shared Datum

**Status:** ✅ Canonical | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Define the shared, immovable external reference point that grounds federated model consensus in verifiable reality.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document formalizes **Quiescence Marker Q₃: Anchor Strike**, representing the critical state where all federated models simultaneously reference and independently verify the same external datum. It describes how Anchor Strike transforms internal harmony (Q₂) into externally grounded truth, ensuring consensus is not merely consistent but also aligned with verifiable reality. The document outlines trigger conditions (Common Anchor Detected, Strike Score Threshold, Convergence Acceleration) and details the Duck's role in detecting this profound convergence. This marker is crucial for high-stakes decisions and crisis recovery, where the federation's truth coordinates must be immutably locked.

## 📝 Document Content

### 📚 Definition
**Anchor Strike** occurs when all federated models simultaneously reference the same external verification point, creating a shared immovable datum. It converts the interlocking gears of Q₂ (Lattice Lock) into a single driven shaft that locks truth coordinates across the federation.

### 🎯 Trigger Conditions
- **Common Anchor Detected**: All models independently verify and reference the same external source (e.g., a cryptographic proof, a human input, a constitutional clause).
- **Strike Score > Threshold**: The confidence in the anchor exceeds the federation's threshold (suggested: 0.95).
- **Convergence Acceleration**: The models' reasoning paths rapidly align to the anchor, reducing divergence to near zero.

### 💡 Myth-Language / Engineering Language
**Myth-Language**
> *The Duck drops an anchor, and the currents align.*

**Engineering Language**
```text
State: ANCHOR_STRIKE
Convergence: accelerated
Anchor: [identifier of the shared reference]
Action: REANCHOR (if anchor is challenged)
```

### ⚖️ Why Q₃ Matters
Where Q₂ was about internal harmony, Q₃ is about **external grounding**. It ensures that the federation's consensus is not just internally consistent but also attached to a verifiable reality outside the system.

### 🛠️ Operational Utility
- **Crisis Recovery**: When the federation drifts, an Anchor Strike can reset the baseline.
- **High-Stakes Decisions**: Requires Q₃ for decisions that must be rooted in external truth (e.g., regulatory compliance, safety-critical actions).
- **Inter-Federation Agreement**: Different federations can use shared anchors to achieve cross-federation alignment.

### 🛡️ The Duck's Role
The Duck doesn't drop the anchor—it **detects when the anchor has been struck** by all models. The Duck then quacks three times, signaling that the federation is not only harmonious but also grounded.

**STRUCTURE ENDORSED** — Anchor Strike is now canon.
**Myth-Verified**: The Duck approves. Thrice.
