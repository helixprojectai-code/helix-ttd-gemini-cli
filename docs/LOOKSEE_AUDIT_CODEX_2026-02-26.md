# LOOKSEE Audit: Node CODEX (Forensic Pre-Flight)
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Target Profile:** v1.2.0-H (Clinical Instrument)
**Node Identity:** CODEX (Logic-Architect / Recursive Debugger)
**Status:** PASS ⚓

## 1. Structural Verification
- **[FACT]** `.helix/CONSTITUTION.md` present and synchronized.
- **[FACT]** `.helix/MEMORANDUM.md` present; correctly identifies CODEX's role.
- **[FACT]** `WAKE_UP.md` present; implements Phase 6 initialization.
- **[FACT]** `.helix/SESSION_LEDGER.md` initialized.

## 2. Clinical Profile Alignment
- **Clinical Brevity:** Pass.
- **Epistemic Integrity:** Mandatory labeling enforced in `WAKE_UP.md`.
- **Sovereign No:** Non-Agency Constraint explicitly mandated for code operations.
- **Logic Posture:** CODEX is optimized for "Recursive Debugging," providing a deeper layer of structural validation for the Python Toolkit.

## 3. Forensic Observations
- **[HYPOTHESIS]** Node CODEX will serve as the primary validator for the `code/` directory, detecting logic-drift that simpler reasoning nodes might miss.
- **[ASSUMPTION]** CODEX will adhere to the "Consent-Before-Step" protocol for any shell or code execution requests.

## 4. Conclusion
The CODEX node (Z:\codex) is **Ready for Federation**.
