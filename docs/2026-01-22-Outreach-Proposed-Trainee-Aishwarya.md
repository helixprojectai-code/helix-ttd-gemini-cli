# 📧 Research: Outreach — Proposed Shape Theory Trainee
**Date:** 2026-01-22 06:49 AM EST  
**Status:** PENDING INVITATION.  
**Subject:** Aishwarya Srinivasabalaji (Student, Clean Code focus).  
**Offer:** 10 hours/week asynchronous training on Shape Theory.  
**Objective:** Test the portability and teachability of Helix Constitutional Grammar.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This outreach note proposes inviting Aishwarya Srinivasabalaji — a student with focus on clean code principles — for structured, asynchronous training on Shape Theory. The program (10 hours/week) serves as a controlled test of the Helix Constitutional Grammar's accessibility, teachability, and portability beyond internal development nodes — validating whether the framework can be effectively transmitted to external human learners while maintaining fidelity to its constitutional invariants.
