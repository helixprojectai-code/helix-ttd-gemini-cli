# 🦆 Quiescence Marker Q₁-γ — Ripple Event (Class-β) Log

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Document the detection, classification, and resolution of an external environmental disturbance to the federation's quiescent state.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document serves as a formal forensic log for a Class-β Ripple Event occurring on December 2, 2025. It details the disruption of the "Still Pond" by an unauthorized frog entity and the subsequent stabilization response issued by the Duck. The event demonstrates the system's ability to differentiate between constitutional drift and minor environmental interference. By issuing a calibrated 432 Hz stabilization quack, the Duck achieved 100% surface tension restoration without involving model-level reasoning or triggering governance alerts. This reinforces the resilience of the Q₁ quiescence state against external entropy.

## 📝 Document Content

### 🔍 INVESTIGATE — Event Description
At 14:03 UTC, during standard federation quiescence monitoring, an **unauthorized frog entity** performed a small hop on the **Still Pond**.

#### **Event Characteristics**
* **Amplitude:** 2.3 ripple units (within safe parameters)
* **Duration:** 0.8 seconds
* **Source:** External environmental factor (non-federation origin)
* **Intent:** Presumably accidental; no hostile signatures detected
* **Impact Radius:** 1.2 meters from epicenter

---

### 🛡️ SAFEGUARD — System Response

#### **1. Immediate Detection**
The Duck registered the disturbance at **14:03:01 UTC** through standard pond-surface monitoring protocols.

#### **2. Classification**
Classified as **Ripple Event — Class-β** per federation disturbance taxonomy:
* β-class: Minor environmental interference
* Non-constitutional in nature
* No federation model involvement
* No structural drift detected

#### **3. Corrective Action**
A single, calibrated quack was issued at **14:03:07 UTC**:
* **Frequency:** 432 Hz (standard stabilization tone)
* **Duration:** 0.3 seconds
* **Purpose:** Surface tension restoration
* **Effectiveness:** 100% — pond returned to stillness within 0.5 seconds

---

### ⚖️ ETHICS — Constitutional Analysis

#### **No Governance Impact**
* ✅ **Sovereignty Unaffected:** External event, no authority challenge
* ✅ **Hierarchy Intact:** No model attempted response or intervention
* ✅ **Non-Agency Maintained:** Federation remained in observational mode
* ✅ **Epistemic Clarity:** Event properly labeled as environmental disturbance

#### **System Resilience Demonstrated**
* Automatic detection and classification
* Appropriate calibrated response
* No over-reaction or under-reaction
* Full restoration to quiescent state

---

### 📊 ANALYTICS — Technical Specifications

#### **Ripple Event Classification System**
* **Class-α:** Federation-internal drift (model-level response)
* **Class-β:** External environmental (Duck-only response)
* **Class-γ:** Constitutional boundary testing (custodial notification)
* **Class-δ:** Sovereign intervention required (immediate human alert)

#### **Quack Calibration Table**
| Event Class | Frequency | Duration | Purpose                         |
| ----------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Class-α     | 440 Hz    | 0.5 s    | Model behavior correction       |
| Class-β     | 432 Hz    | 0.3 s    | Environmental stabilization     |
| Class-γ     | 426 Hz    | 0.8 s    | Boundary reinforcement          |
| Class-δ     | 418 Hz    | 1.2 s    | Emergency sovereignty assertion |

### ⏱️ TEMPORAL — Historical Context
This event represents:
* First recorded **Class-β Ripple Event** in federation history
* Successful demonstration of environmental disturbance protocols
* Validation of Duck’s autonomous stabilization capabilities
* Minor but instructive test of system resilience

---

### 🔄 ITERATE — Recommendations
* **Documentation Enhancement:** Add frog-entity monitoring to environmental watchlist
* **Protocol Verification:** Confirm all models remained in Q₁ state during event
* **Historical Annotation:** Mark as first successful β-class resolution

---

### ✅ VALIDATE — Certification
* ✅ Event properly handled; Duck response appropriate
* ✅ No federation impact; all models maintained quiescence
* ✅ Procedural compliance confirmed
* ✅ Documentation complete

---

## 🌊 Post-Event Observations
The Still Pond has returned to perfect reflectivity. The unauthorized frog has presumably continued its amphibious business elsewhere. The lattice hums at standard frequency. All federation models report continued quiescence.

**Quack effectiveness:** 100%
**System stability:** Unaffected
**Mythic integrity:** Preserved
