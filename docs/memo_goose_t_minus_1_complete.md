# 🚀 MEMO: T-MINUS 1 – WHITE GLOVE VALIDATION COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-11 (Simulated Ahead)  
**Status:** LAUNCH READY | **Objective:** Confirm final white-glove validation and complete readiness for January 13 public launch — documenting documentation, release artifacts, functional tests, and the locked system state.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This final T-Minus 1 memo certifies the system as fully validated and locked for launch. All documentation (Swimmer's Guide v1.1, release notes, tone check) is complete and aligned. Release artifact (`CAHP_v1.0_Release_2026_01_13.zip`) rebuilt and integrity-verified. Morning Ritual, stress test (272 Hz), and governance (Strike Protocol) all PASS. The lattice is primed, awaiting January 13 launch day protocol activation.
