# 📚 Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar — Contribution Guidelines

**Status:** ✅ Active | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Provide clear guidelines for contributing to the Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar project while preserving custodial sovereignty and constitutional integrity.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document outlines the contribution guidelines for the Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar project, emphasizing adherence to its foundational principles. It details the project's custodial authority structure and mandates compliance with the Four Immutable Invariants (Custodial Sovereignty, Epistemic Integrity, Non-Agency Constraint, Structure Is Teacher). The guide specifies welcome contributions (empirical reports, model appendices, documentation), explicitly prohibits contributions that introduce agency or authority redefinition, and details a structured process for issue submission, branching, changes, testing, and pull requests. It serves as a comprehensive framework for channeling community energy while preventing constitutional drift.

## 📝 Document Content

## 🤝 Welcome

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar** project.

This repository operates under the same constitutional principles it documents. All contributions must respect the custodial hierarchy, maintain epistemic integrity, and preserve the non-agency constraints that define the grammar.

---

## 🛡️ Custodial Authority

**[FACT]** This project operates under custodial sovereignty. The repository maintainer holds final authority over all merge decisions, architectural direction, and constitutional interpretation.

**[ASSUMPTION]** Contributors understand that pull requests are advisory proposals, not demands. The custodian may accept, reject, modify, or defer any contribution without detailed justification.

**Advisory Note:**
This is not arbitrary gatekeeping — it is constitutional alignment. The grammar explicitly prohibits distributed authority and emergent consensus mechanisms that could undermine custodial hierarchy.
