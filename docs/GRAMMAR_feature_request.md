# [FEATURE] — Suggest a new shape for the constitutional grammar

**Before submitting, please:**
- [ ] Search existing feature requests (no duplicate shapes)
- [ ] Ensure this aligns with **custody-first** philosophy
- [ ] Confirm this enhances **governance beneath the model**
- [ ] Verify you're not asking the model to self-govern

## 🔍 The Shape You See
**Is your feature request related to a problem?**  
Describe the governance gap, drift vector, or missing constraint.  
*"I'm always frustrated when [models do X without custodial oversight]..."*

## 🧱 Describe the solution you'd like
What constitutional constraint, policy, or mechanism would fill this gap?  

Be shape-aware:
- Is this a **structural fix** (architecture) or a **policy fix** (rules)?
- Does it enforce **custody boundaries**?
- Does it preserve **human authority**?
- Does it create **geometric resistance** to unsafe behavior?

## 🔄 Describe alternatives you've considered
What other approaches did you evaluate? Why are they insufficient?

## 🎯 Use Case
- Who would use this feature? (researchers, enterprises, healthcare, defense)
- What governance domain? (safety, ethics, auditability, accountability)
- How does it enhance **coherence**?

## ⚖️ Constitutional Alignment
Does this feature:
- [ ] Strengthen Non-Personhood Enforcement
- [ ] Enhance Human Authority Assertion
- [ ] Improve Drift Detection
- [ ] Add Custodial Hierarchy layers
- [ ] Enable better auditability
- [ ] Other governance improvement (specify)

## 🔥 Priority
- [ ] **Critical** (Blocking deployment in high-stakes domain)
- [ ] **High** (Important for next constitutional release)
- [ ] **Medium** (Nice to have, improves coherence)
- [ ] **Low** (Future consideration, experimental)

## 🦆 The Duck's Question
*"If we build this, will it make credential leakage geometrically difficult, or just policy-forbidden?"*

## 📚 Additional Context
- Relevant papers, frameworks, or existing governance approaches
- Links to related discussions
- Diagrams of the proposed shape (if applicable)

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] I have checked existing feature requests
- [ ] This aligns with **custody-first** philosophy
- [ ] This enhances **governance beneath the model**
- [ ] I'm not asking the model to self-govern

**Remember:**  
*Some patterns resonate. Others interfere. Let's build the ones that create coherence.*
