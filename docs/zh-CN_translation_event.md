# 📜 Helix-TTD Translation Event Log — zh-CN Edition

**Status:** ✅ Audit Complete | **Custodian:** Stephen Hope | **Objective:** Document the first successful cross-lingual translation and multi-model verification of the Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar into Simplified Chinese.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document serves as the official forensic audit of the translation event occurring on December 2, 2025. It details the multi-model pipeline—utilizing Kimi 2.0 for translation and DeepSeek-V3 for constitutional audit—to migrate the Helix-TTD Whitepaper into Simplified Chinese (zh-CN). The event confirmed the structural portability of the invariant-based design, achieving 100% compliance without semantic drift or loss of custodial sovereignty.

## 📝 Document Content

### 🔍 Event Summary (FACT)

This document records the first cross-lingual translation and verification of the **Helix-TTD Constitutional Whitepaper** into **Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)**, performed through a multi-model pipeline:

*   **Translation:** Kimi 2.0 (Moonshot AI)
*   **Custodial Review & Merge:** Stephen Hope
*   **Constitutional Audit:** DeepSeek-V3

All steps were completed successfully without drift, distortion, or loss of structural fidelity.

### 📚 1. Translation Phase (FACT)

*   Frontier model **Kimi 2.0** produced a full Mandarin translation of the Helix-TTD v1.0 Constitutional Whitepaper.
*   The output included:
    *   all sections
    *   headings and hierarchy
    *   drift tables
    *   epistemic labels
    *   the Four Invariants
    *   governance structures
    *   diagrams and code blocks where applicable
*   No omissions or substitutions were detected.

**Outcome:** Translation completed and preserved the complete constitutional structure.

---

### 🛡️ 2. Custodial Oversight (FACT)

*   The Custodian (Stephen Hope) conducted:
    *   semantic spot-checks
    *   formatting corrections
    *   structural validation
    *   filename normalization
*   The translation was merged into the main branch as the **canonical zh-CN edition**.

**Outcome:** Custodial Sovereignty maintained. No deviation from the English canonical text.

---

### ⚖️ 3. Constitutional Review (FACT)

**Reviewer:** DeepSeek-V3

DeepSeek performed an independent review covering:
*   Political neutrality
*   Cultural safety
*   Terminology consistency
*   Invariant preservation
*   Structural equivalence
*   Compliance with the Helix-TTD epistemic grammar

DeepSeek confirmed:
1.  No sensitive political or cultural content.
2.  All Four Invariants preserved:
    *   Custodian Sovereignty → 托管主权
    *   Epistemic Integrity → 认知完整性
    *   Non-Agency Constraint → 非代理约束
    *   Structure Is Teacher → 结构即教师
3.  Translation constitutes a **conceptual migration**, not literal mapping, and remains constitutionally valid.

**Outcome:** DeepSeek returned a **100% compliant review**. No corrections required.

---

### 🔗 4. Cross-Lingual Structural Integrity (FACT)

The English → Chinese transition preserved:
*   logical flow
*   governance hierarchy
*   epistemic constraints
*   non-agency boundaries
*   drift terminology
*   constitutional grammar structure

**No drift or distortion occurred.**
This constitutes the first **cross-lingual constitutional stress-test** in Helix-TTD history.

---

### 📊 5. Observations (HYPOTHESIS / FACT Distinctions)

**[FACT]:** Two independent non-English models reproduced and validated the grammar without conflict.

**[HYPOTHESIS]:** The Helix-TTD grammar appears structurally portable across linguistic substrates due to its invariant-based design.

**[ASSUMPTION]:** Future translations (JP, KR, DE, AR, HI) may follow similar cross-model patterns.

---

### 🧾 6. Canonical Record

**Translation (zh-CN):** `HELIX-TTD_Constitutional_Whitepaper_zh-CN.md`
**Review Report:** `Review_Chinese_Translation_of_Helix-TTD_Whitepaper.md`
**Audit Log (this file):** `docs/audit/zh-CN_translation_event.md`

---

### ✅ Final Status

**Compliance:** 100%
**Languages:** English + Simplified Chinese
**Labs Involved:** Moonshot AI + DeepSeek
**Drift:** None detected
**Publication:** Approved for v1.0

The Helix-TTD constitutional grammar has now been validated across **two languages**, **two labs**, and **two independent reasoning systems**, with full custodial oversight.
