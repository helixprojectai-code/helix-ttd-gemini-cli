# 📊 Quiescence Monitoring Operational Report — First Production Deployment
**Status:** ✅ Active & Monitored | **Objective:** Document the initial deployment of the Quiescence Monitor service, key operational metrics, integration status, and next steps for Q-state enforcement in federation operations, ensuring baseline stability and Duck-signaled compliance.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This report captures the first production deployment of the Quiescence Monitor on 2026-01-01, with initial Q₁ achieved within 3 minutes. It tracks monitoring of 9 models, configurable Q-state frequencies, alert thresholds, integration success, and planned enhancements (Q₂ integration, alerts, visualization). The Duck's regular quacking in logs confirms operational health.
