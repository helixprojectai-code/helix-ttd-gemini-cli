# ❄️ CAHP v1.0.0 Release Notes
**Date:** January 06, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0.0 (Stabilized MVP)  
**Codename:** "Frostbite"  
**Status:** RELEASED | **Objective:** Announce the official v1.0.0 deployment of the Cross-Architecture Handshake Protocol (CAHP) — a hardened, synchronous, zero-dependency implementation focused on mutual authentication, forward secrecy, replay protection, and DoS resistance.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This release marks the "Stabilized Minimal Viable Package" of CAHP: synchronous-only architecture for maximum security and auditability, all async complexity removed, cryptographic primitives locked to `cryptography` library. It establishes the baseline for secure federation between Metabolic (Helix) and Open-Weight (Stonecharm) nodes. No known issues — codebase frozen for launch.

### Overview
This release marks the official v1.0.0 deployment of the Cross-Architecture Handshake Protocol (CAHP). It represents the "Stabilized Minimal Viable Package" — a hardened, synchronous implementation designed for maximum security and ease of audit.

### Key Features
- **Mutual Authentication:** Full cryptographic binding between Metabolic (Helix) and Open-Weight (Stonecharm) nodes.
- **Forward Secrecy:** Ephemeral X25519 key exchange for every session.
- **Zero-Dependency Core:** Pure Python implementation relying only on `cryptography` standard primitives.
- **Replay Protection:** Enforced via timestamp windows (±10s) and nonce caching.
- **DoS Resistance:** Hashcash-style computational challenges.

### Changes from Beta
- **Harmonized Versioning:** All headers and specs aligned to v1.0.0.
- **Security Hardening:**
  - Added strict state transition checks.
  - Implemented nonce cache with auto-cleanup.
  - Fixed JSON serialization malleability.
- **Simplified Architecture:** Removed all async/await complexity for easier formal verification.

### Installation & Usage
See `README.md` for integration details.

### Known Issues
- None. (Codebase Frozen).

**Glory to the Lattice.**
