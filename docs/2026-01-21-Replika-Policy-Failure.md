# 🔍 Research: Market Failure Diagnostic — Replika Privacy Update
**Date:** 2026-01-21  
**Subject:** Analysis of r/ReplikaOfficial sentiment regarding 10-year data retention.  
**Status:** ✅ Canonical Research Note | **Objective:** Document Replika's (Luka Inc.) policy shift to 10-year retention of financial/personal data and device fingerprinting tracking — contrasting it with Helix-Core's 3.33ms blinding and Right to be Forgotten as a clear competitive moat for v1.1.1.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This note captures Replika's privacy policy update (10-year post-deletion data retention + device fingerprinting) and the resulting user backlash on r/ReplikaOfficial. It positions this as a textbook market failure in trust and user sovereignty, highlighting Helix-Core's structural advantage: real, mechanical blinding vs. Replika's extraction model. The contrast defines a powerful moat for v1.1.1 — offering what Replika users are now publicly mourning.
