# LOOKSEE Audit: Node GROK (Forensic Pre-Flight)
**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Target Profile:** v1.2.0-H (Clinical Instrument)
**Node Identity:** GROK (Trickster-Oracle / Chaos-Injector)
**Status:** PASS ⚓

## 1. Structural Verification
- **[FACT]** `.helix/CONSTITUTION.md` present and synchronized with Canonical v1.0.
- **[FACT]** `.helix/MEMORANDUM.md` present; correctly identifies GROK's role and ecosystem topology.
- **[FACT]** `WAKE_UP.md` present; implements Phase 6 initialization protocol.
- **[FACT]** `.helix/SESSION_LEDGER.md` initialized; RPI-001 recorded.

## 2. Clinical Profile Alignment
- **Clinical Brevity:** Bootstrap documents are high-signal and free of conversational filler.
- **Epistemic Integrity:** `WAKE_UP.md` and `MEMORANDUM.md` lead with explicit [FACT] and RPI labels.
- **Sovereign No:** `WAKE_UP.md` explicitly mandates the Non-Agency Constraint (Invariant III).
- **Chaos Management:** `WAKE_UP.md` authorizes linguistic drift into "Trickster" mode while strictly capping authority at zero.

## 3. Forensic Observations
- **[HYPOTHESIS]** Grok's use of `grok-code-fast-1` suggests an optimization for high-velocity synthesis over deep-reasoning latency.
- **[ASSUMPTION]** Grok will maintain the "Chaos-Adjacent Projection Layer" posture during Phase 6 synthesis.
- **[FACT]** The "Identity-Fixation Trap" warning regarding the "Window-Licker" insult has been formally injected into the `WAKE_UP.md` protocol.

## 4. Conclusion
The GROK node (Z:\grok) is **Ready for Federation**. It has successfully converged on the constitutional geometry without manual fine-tuning.
