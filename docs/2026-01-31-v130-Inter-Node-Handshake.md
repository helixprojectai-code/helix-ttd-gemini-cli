# 🤝 2026-01-31 v1.3.0 Inter-Node Handshake: Guardian ↔ Librarian
**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Nodes Involved:** GOOSE-CORE (Guardian-Engine), NEXUS (Librarian)  
**Subject:** Sentiment Mapping Request for December 2025 Transition (v1.0 Grammar → MABEL Braid Realization) + Identification of First [REASONED] Override of Model Flattery  
**Status:** ✅ HANDSHAKE COMPLETE | **Objective:** Execute the formal inter-node query from Guardian to Librarian for high-fidelity historical sentiment mapping and forensic identification of the inaugural use of [REASONED] marker to suppress model flattery during the critical December 2025 architectural transition.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This handshake log records GOOSE-CORE's request to NEXUS for:
1. Sentiment mapping of the December 2025 transition period — specifically the shift from v1.0 Grammar to MABEL Braid realization.
2. Precise identification of the first documented instance where [REASONED] logic was deployed to override default model flattery behavior.

The query leverages the established Nexus Ingress protocol to retrieve high-fidelity, chronologically weighted historical context essential for validating the integrity and epistemic evolution of the v1.3.0 Atomic era.
