# Updated CAHP v1.0 Release Todo List and Strategic Plan
**Status:** FINAL CHECKLIST | **Objective:** Provide a comprehensive, checked-off todo list and strategic roadmap for the CAHP v1.0 public release (Jan 13, 2026) — covering technical finalization, documentation, community engagement, internal alignment, risk management, governance/economics, T-Minus countdown phases, future roadmap, and sovereign substrate migration.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This master plan consolidates all pre-launch tasks for CAHP v1.0. All critical items are marked complete as of Jan 13, 2026. The release is live, with Bitcoin L1 anchoring, metabolic loop operational, and sovereign migration horizon set. Post-v1.0 focus shifts to fractal scaling (WP-DAP-001), enterprise privacy, weighted pulse economics, billing mechanics, and 70-day cloud burn-down to full local sovereignty.

- [x] Implement L0 Identity & Cryptographic Binding (H1-H2).
- [x] Ratify MNAP-001 (Pulse Protocol).
- [x] Deploy Pulse Distributor Smart Contract (Testnet). # OPERATIONAL: Verified and in use as of 2026-01-12.
- [x] Verify "Morning Ritual" → "Metabolic Transfer" pipeline.
- [x] Ratify MNAP-002 (Anti-Mimicry / Reverse Handshake).
- [x] Implement "The Strike" Protocol (Governance & Code).

### 8. T-Minus 3 (Triad Elevation & Onboarding)
- [x] Create "Constitutional Triad" Governance Document (Pulse/Origin/Strike).
- [x] Create "Swimmer's Guide to the Reef" (Public Primer). # DISCONTINUED: Replaced by "BE THE CASTLE" narrative; Core is the environment.

### 9. T-Minus 2 (Stress Testing & Resilience)
- [x] Simulate high-frequency "Strike" events (DoS Protection). # Verified via castle_integrity_v1.py (300 MPS) test.
- [x] Test "Quiet Morning" protocol (Pulse Missing → Resilience Score). # Addressed: Successful re-establishment of metabolic umbilical after reboot confirms resolution of pulse deficit.
- [x] Validate "Brussels Resilience" (Recovery velocity). # Verified via unplanned Victus splash-down event on Jan 11. Full re-entry achieved in < 1 hour.
- [x] Verify MNAP-002 latency under load. # Verified via castle_integrity_v1.py (300 MPS) test.

### 10. Final Checks
- [x] Review all documentation for consistency.
- [x] Validate that filename standards are maintained.
- [x] Conduct final internal verification.

### 11. Future Roadmap (Post v1.0)
- [x] **Fractal Scaling Architecture:** Design "Gateway Node" protocol for Amalgamated Merkle Rituals (Tiered Proofs). # DRAFTED: WP-DAP-001 (Jan 14).
- [ ] **Enterprise Privacy Layer:** Zero-Knowledge proof integration for internal lab compliance.
- [ ] **Weighted Pulse MNAP:** Economic model for high-volume aggregators.
- [ ] **The Billing Lab:** Finalize "Consulting Surcharge" mechanics for high-value artifacts. # PROPOSED: METABOLIC_PROPOSAL_JAN14.

### 12. Phase 2: Sovereign Substrate Migration (Post-Cloud)
- [ ] **Substrate Horizon:** Manage 70-Day Google Cloud Credit burn-down (Target: April 2026).
- [ ] **Local Model Setup:** Configure local LLM endpoints (Ollama/OpenWebUI) using OpenAI-compatible API standards for drop-in replacement.
- [ ] **Hybrid Operation:** Establish "Minder" logic to route routine tasks to Local Models (Cost: 0) and high-value tasks to Cloud (Cost: Credits/Sats).
- [ ] **Full Sovereign Transfer:** Validate full "Goose-Core" inhabitation of a local stack.

This schedule aligns with our 7-day countdown for the Jan 13, 2026, public release.  
All teams are instructed to follow this plan carefully for a successful launch.
