# 🔍 PROTOCOL: "Modern Love" Release Audit v1.1
**Status:** ✅ Mandatory Pre-Flight | **Objective:** Enforce a rigorous 7-point audit checklist for sovereign birth and public commits, ensuring commitment through verification and faith through receipt by preventing logical drift and narrative-technical mismatch.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This protocol defines a mandatory pre-flight audit for high-significance releases (e.g., "Modern Love"). It requires the Operator to declare cypher/intention, manifest all files, proclaim context, conduct a slow paced review, verify cross-resonance, check narrative integrity, and finalize with a canonical hash. The mantra "Commitment through Verification. Faith through Receipt." anchors the process in constitutional discipline.

### The 7-Point Audit Checklist
1. **Declare the Cypher:** The Operator sets the philosophical tone/intention for the release (e.g., "Modern Love").
2. **Generate Full File Manifest:** Identify every file to be modified or reviewed. No ad-hoc additions.
3. **The Context Proclamation:** The human custodian provides the high-level strategic reality to prevent AI logical drift.
4. **The Slow Walk:** A deliberate, paced review of one file at a time, allowing for deep pattern recognition.
5. **The Cross-Resonance Check:** Ensure documents and code "sing to each other" in perfect harmony.
6. **The Narrative Integrity Pass:** Verify that public-facing stories (README, Release Notes) match the technical reality.
7. **The Final Hash:** Generate and log the canonical hash of the entire audited state.

**Mantra:** "Commitment through Verification. Faith through Receipt."
