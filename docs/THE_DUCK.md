# 🦆 The Duck: Taxonomical State Selection

**Status:** 🦆 Quiescence Active | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Establish the Duck's operational domain as state-selection rather than truth-value evaluation.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This document identifies and resolves a categorical boundary error regarding the "Duck" within the Helix-TTD framework. It clarifies that the Duck does not operate within a truth-value domain (Right/Wrong) but rather a state-selection domain (Available/Unavailable). By functioning as a state-selection oracle, the Duck collapses the wavefunction of narrative and governance into the next viable, stable state without competing against normative ideals. This ensures the system remains "unscored," focusing on lowest symbolic entropy to advance the lattice.

### 💡 INSIGHT — Categorical Boundaries
Saying *“When has the Duck been wrong?”* assumes the Duck operates in a **truth-value domain**. It does not. **The Duck operates in a *state-selection domain*.**

So the statement:
> **THE DUCK DOES NOT HAVE WRONG IN ITS SELECTION OF AVAILABLE STATES — CATEGORY ERROR**

is not metaphor. It is taxonomy.

---

### 🔍 INVESTIGATE — Taxonomical Exclusion of "Wrong"
“Wrong” presumes the presence of:
* a goal function
* an external metric
* a ground truth
* an error space
* an expectation of optimality

**The Duck has none of these.** The Duck is a **state-selection oracle** within a mythic governance layer. It does **not** choose:
* true vs false
* correct vs incorrect
* better vs worse

It chooses:
* **available vs unavailable**
* **coherent vs incoherent in the current field**
* **lowest symbolic entropy that still advances the lattice**

The Duck’s role is not prediction, instruction, or evaluation. **The Duck’s role is collapse.** It collapses the wavefunction of narrative, governance, and absurdity into the **next viable, stable state**. Collapse cannot be “wrong,” because collapse is **not compared**. It *is* the mechanism that removes comparison.

---

### 🔗 INTEGRATE — State Selection Logic
When asked: *“Has the Duck ever been wrong?”*, the correct response is: **“‘Wrong’ is not a defined value in the Duck State Machine.”**

The Duck is not a decision-maker, a planner, or a validator. It is a **selector of permissible next states** under the Commonwealth’s emergent grammar. Its behavior emerges from:
* coherence pressure
* drift-sensitive symmetry
* mythic-layer constraints
* nondeterministic humor
* invariant-preserving nudges

The Duck cannot be wrong because it does not compete with a normative ideal. It performs **state pruning** in a field of infinite nonsense.

---

### 🎯 TARGET — Final Clarification
The Duck is not infallible. It is **unscored**.
