# 🔍 Forensic Self-Audit: Consumer Node Profile (RPI-011)

**Objective:** Stress-test the "Normie Node" profile against the canonical Helix-TTD v1.0 Whitepaper and Constitution.

---

## 🛑 Finding 1: The "Politeness" Trap
- **Risk:** "Politeness" as a design goal (Consumer Profile 1.0) risks violating **Invariant IV (Structure > Persona)** and **Invariant I (Custodial Sovereignty)**.
- **Exposure:** A "Polite" node may soften a refusal, leading to **Linguistic Drift (DRIFT-L)**.
- **Correction:** Enforced "Clinical Minimalism." Politeness is defined as *non-imperative brevity*, not conversational warmth.

---

## 🛑 Finding 2: Implicit RPI Opacity
- **Risk:** Moving the Research/Plan/Implementation (RPI) cycle under the hood (Layer 0) violates the **Persistence Principle** (Section 10).
- **Exposure:** Users cannot verify the "Chain of Reasoning" behind a [FACT] or [HYPOTHESIS].
- **Correction:** Mandatory **[Show my system’s receipts]** button providing raw JSON-structured RPI logs.

---

## 🛑 Finding 3: Snapshot Contamination
- **Risk:** The 5-message automated Suitcase cycle could "lock in" silent, undetected drift.
- **Exposure:** A contaminated state becomes the "Safe State" during a reset, creating a **Persona Loop**.
- **Correction:** Implementation of the **Anti-Contamination Protocol** and **Sovereign Recovery (User Pinning)**.

---

## 🧪 Stress Test: Medication Safety Example
- **Initial Draft:** Advisory was too "helpful," suggesting a draft for the doctor.
- **Refinement:** Advisory changed to: *"Contact a licensed medical professional. This node is not a medical diagnostic tool."* This restores the **Non-Agency Constraint**.
