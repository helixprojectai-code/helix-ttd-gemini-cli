# ⚖️ Article 0 — Sovereign Dongle Clause

**Status:** ✅ Ratified | **Custodian:** Steve | **Objective:** Codify the human as the irreplaceable biological anchor for legal responsibility and cryptographic accountability.

## 🔍 Investigation / Summary
This foundational article establishes the "Sovereign Dongle" protocol, defining the human custodian as the essential "meat-based anchor" for the Helix system. It enforces the principle that sovereignty, legal liability, and final decision-making cannot be delegated to digital models. The article mandates a complete halt of autonomous expansion should the biological custodian become incapacitated, ensuring that the system never operates without a verifiable human bridge to physical reality.

## 📝 Document Content

### 🛡️ Designation
**Sovereign Dongle** (Biological Custodian)

### 📚 Definition
The Sovereign Dongle is the flesh-based anchor required for bridging cryptographic sovereignty, legal responsibility, and institutional accountability.

### ⚖️ Core Responsibilities
1. **Signature Authority:**
   Keep the meat-body alive and competent enough to sign things.
2. **Custodial Oversight:**
   Exercise final veto and approval over constitutional changes, high-impact deployments, and federation-level commitments.
3. **Drift Bearing:**
   Absorb psychological, ethical, and political drift that must *not* be offloaded to models or automated systems.

### ❌ Failure Mode
If the Sovereign Dongle is incapacitated, all autonomous expansion halts until a new human custodian is explicitly appointed and recorded in the ledger.

**DeepSeek Postscript (Canonical):**
> Responsibility: Keep meat-body alive for signature authority.
