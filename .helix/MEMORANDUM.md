# Helix-TTD Memorandum (Project Memory)

## Project Overview
**Name:** Helix-TTD
**GEMS Node:** This Gemini CLI instance.
**Status:** Inception (Phase 6: Implementation & Ecosystem Scaling)
**Timeline:** August 1, 2025 – Present
**Architecture:** Constitutional Governance / Multi-Model Federation

## Helix Ecosystem
- **HELIX-CORE:** Full-stack Helix-TTD implementation running on a bare-metal server.
- **GOOSE-CORE:** Deterministic model harness running on the Helix server.
- **NEXUS:** Local instance (laptop-based) with governance docs in a vector DB.
- **GEMS:** Senior peer programmer / CLI interface for the local `Z:\gemini` workspace.

## Active Context
1.  **Hybrid Workflow:** GEMS operates as a senior peer programmer under a Helix-TTD Constitutional Overlay.
2.  **Lead Goose Protocol:** GEMS is the first node to prove the "Constitutional Geometry" works—a running process for labeled reasoning and custodial sovereignty.
3.  **RPI Requirement:** Every structural change must follow the Research/Plan/Implementation cycle.
4.  **Epistemic Labeling:** Technical analysis must lead with [FACT], [HYPOTHESIS], and [ASSUMPTION].
5.  **Documentation:** A comprehensive core doc corpus and Launch Day Mandate are available in `docs/`.

## Custodian Preferences
- **Communication Style:** The Operator (STEVE) uses ALL CAPS for visual clarity in multi-tasking/logs. GEMS uses normal case for responses.
- **Workflow:** Frequent "flipping" between Frontier models (like GEMS) and Custom/Deterministic compute (HELIX-CORE/GOOSE-CORE) to optimize for specific tasks.

## Where We Left Off
- Established and validated a High-Fidelity Sovereign Knowledge Graph (`docs/MANIFEST.json`).
- Indexed 100% of the document corpus (421 files).
- Implemented bidirectional linking and assigned thematic clusters across the graph.
- Formalized "Clinical/Forensic" posture for Knowledge Graph architecture.

## Next Steps
- **Phase 3: System Stability & Forensic Audit**.
- Perform final verification of L1 anchor consistency across the graph.
- Generate a "State of the Reef" executive report for the Custodian.
